we should work together to build an open economic environment in the region We should keep promoting trade and investment liberalization and facilitation deepen fiscal and financial cooperation and

so as to inject impetus into the development of the FTAAP Third we should work together to keep industrial and supply chains stable and smooth We must join hands rather than part ways and strengthen our links rather than sever them We should vigorously expand our common interests and support the open development of supply chains The tenth anniversary of the APEC Connectivity Blueprint gives us a good opportunity to strive for concrete and tangible results in physical institutional and people to people connectivity so as to further consolidate the foundations for open development in our region

Friends Women in every corner of the world are bound together by a shared future At present complex challenges still hamper their all round development Statistics show that globally over million women and girls are still mired in war and conflict and around percent of women and girls are trapped in extreme poverty At the same time deep rooted problems such as violence and discrimination still

Conference on Women and build greater consensus broaden the paths forward and take more concrete actions to accelerate the new process of women s all round development To this end I wish to make four proposals First we should jointly foster an enabling environment for women s growth and development Their all round development is achieved under the prerequisite of peace and tranquility We need to uphold the vision of common comprehensive cooperative and sustainable security and must safeguard world peace so that all women can bask in the sunlight of happiness and tranquility and stay away from the shadow of war and turmoil We need to enhance the protection of women and girls in regions struck by war conflict poverty or natural disaster and support the vital role of women in preventing conflict and rebuilding their homes We should improve mechanisms against violence and resolutely crack down on all forms of violence against women Second we should jointly cultivate powerful momentum for the high quality development of women s cause Modernization of the world should involve and benefit women We should proactively address the imbalance and inadequacy of women s development around the world enable all women to share the benefits of economic globalization and propel women s all round development We need to seize the opportunity of the new wave of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation and empower women s high quality development through innovation We need to support women in playing an even bigger role in green development and strive to help them shine in life and realize their dreams in this era of global modernization Third we should jointly develop governance frameworks to protect women s rights and interests We need to improve institutions and laws introduce further tangible and accessible policy measures channel more quality health and educational resources to all women and strive to afford all women full and equal enjoyment of various rights We must promote an inclusive and harmonious social environment that sets women free from discrimination and bias We should broaden the channels for women to participate in and deliberate on political affairs and support their extensive engagement in state and social governance We should jointly nurture an environment that respects women and morph gender equality into a common value and a code of conduct embraced by everyone in our society Fourth we should jointly write a new chapter in promoting global cooperation on women Not long ago I proposed the Global Governance Initiative calling for a more just and equitable global governance system with the people s interests in mind Women are crucial in reforming and improving the global governance system We must support them in assuming their historic responsibilities enabling them to play a substantive role in global governance and share in its benefits We should support the central role of the United Nations UN urging it to pay more attention to the needs of women in developing countries create broad cooperation platforms for women from all countries and continually deepen exchanges and mutual learning so as to help women across the world thrive and shine together Ladies and Gentlemen Friends In China the cause of women has always been an integral part of the epic Chinese modernization endeavors Thanks to years of hard work we have secured historic achievements and seen historic changes in the cause of women in China We have won the largest battle against poverty in human history and thereby brought moderate prosperity to million women achieving ahead of schedule the poverty reduction goal of the UN s Agenda for Sustainable Development We have reduced maternal mortality ratio by nearly percent since and joined the leading upper middle income countries in core indicators for maternal and child health Today women in China truly hold up half the sky in economic and social development They make up more than percent of the workforce more than half of internet start up founders and more than percent of all medalists in the past four Summer Olympic Games In the new era Chinese women more confident and vibrant than ever before are taking part in the whole process of state and social governance They are fighting on the front lines for rural revitalization and common prosperity as well as scientific innovation and digital transition They are writing a splendid history of the cause of women in China On the new journey of Chinese modernization every woman is a star

Girls and Women s Education in partnership with UNESCO We have launched maternal and child health happy campuses and other small and beautiful public welfare projects We are actively promoting international exchanges and cooperation on women under Belt and Road cooperation in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and within other frameworks To further support the global cause of women I d

the address Forging Ahead in Solidarity and Cooperation Statement by H E Xi Jinping President of the People s Republic of China At the Virtual BRICS Summit September Your Excellency President Luiz In cio Lula da Silva Distinguished Colleagues It is very relevant that we BRICS leaders have this virtual summit today to discuss thoroughly the current international situation and issues of common interest As we speak transformation unseen in a century is accelerating across the world Hegemonism unilateralism and protectionism are getting more and more rampant Trade wars and tariff wars waged by some country severely disrupt the world economy and undermine international trade rules At this critical juncture BRICS countries standing at the forefront of the Global South should act on the BRICS Spirit of openness inclusiveness and win win cooperation jointly defend multilateralism and the multilateral trading system advance greater BRICS cooperation and build a community with a shared future for humanity To this end I wish to make three proposals First we should uphold multilateralism to defend international fairness and justice History tells us that multilateralism is the shared aspiration of the people and the overarching trend of our time It provides an important underpinning for world peace and development The Global Governance Initiative that I proposed is aimed at galvanizing joint global action for a more just and equitable global governance system We should follow the principle of extensive consultation and joint contribution for shared benefit and safeguard the international system with the United Nations at its core and the international order based on international law so as to cement the foundations of multilateralism At the same time we should actively promote greater democracy in international relations and increase the representation and voice of Global South countries We should improve the global governance system through reform so as to fully mobilize resources from all quarters and tackle more effectively the common challenges for humanity Second we should uphold openness and win win cooperation to safeguard the international economic and trade order Economic globalization is an irresistible trend of history Countries cannot thrive without an international environment of open cooperation and no country can afford to retreat to self imposed isolation No matter how the international landscape may evolve we must stay committed to building an open global economy so as to share opportunities and achieve win win outcomes in openness We should uphold the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core and oppose all forms of protectionism We should promote a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization place development at the heart of our international agenda and ensure that Global South countries participate in international cooperation as equals and share in the fruits of development Third we should uphold solidarity and cooperation to foster synergy for common development As a Chinese saying goes It takes a good blacksmith to forge good steel We can only cope with external challenges more effectively when we manage our own affairs well in the first place BRICS countries account for nearly half of the world s population around percent of global economic output and one fifth of global trade We are also home to major natural resources big manufacturers and vast markets The more closely we work together the more resilient resourceful and effective we are in addressing external risks and challenges China is ready to work with fellow BRICS countries to implement the Global Development Initiative and advance high quality Belt and Road cooperation We should leverage our respective strengths deepen practical cooperation and make our business financial scientific and technological cooperation more productive so as to strengthen the foundation momentum and impact of greater BRICS cooperation and deliver more practical benefits to our peoples Distinguished Colleagues Strong wind tests the resilience of grass and fierce fire reveals true gold As long as we step up to take our responsibilities and look out for each other the giant ship of BRICS will brave the shifting international tides and sail far and steady Thank you

Organization Plus Meeting Tianjin September Distinguished Colleagues This year marks the th anniversary of the victory of the World Anti Fascist War and the founding of the United Nations It is a milestone prompting us to remember the past and create a better future together Eighty years ago the international community learned profound lessons from the scourge of two world wars and founded the United Nations thus writing a new page in global governance Eighty years later while the historical trends of peace development cooperation and mutual benefit remain unchanged the Cold War mentality hegemonism and protectionism continue to haunt the world New threats and challenges have been only increasing The world has found itself in a new period of turbulence and transformation Global governance has come to a new crossroads History tells us that at difficult times we must uphold our original commitment to peaceful coexistence strengthen our confidence in win win cooperation advance in line with the trend of history and thrive in keeping pace with the times To this end I wish to propose the Global Governance Initiative GGI I look forward to working with all countries for a more just and equitable global governance system and advancing toward a community with a shared future for humanity First we should adhere to sovereign equality We should maintain that all countries regardless of size strength and wealth are equal participants decision makers and beneficiaries in global governance We should promote greater democracy in international relations and increase the representation and voice of developing countries Second we should abide by international rule of law The purposes and principles of the UN Charter and other universally recognized basic norms of international relations must be observed comprehensively fully and in their entirety International law and rules should be applied equally and uniformly There should be no double standards and the house rules of a few countries must not be imposed upon others Third we should practice multilateralism We should uphold the vision of global governance featuring extensive consultation and joint contribution for shared benefit strengthen solidarity and coordination and oppose unilateralism We should firmly safeguard the status and authority of the UN and ensure its irreplaceable key role in global governance Fourth we should advocate the people centered approach We should reform and improve the global governance system to ensure that the people of every nation are the actors in and beneficiaries of global governance so as to better tackle the common challenges for mankind better narrow the North South gap and better safeguard the common interests of all countries Fifth we should focus on taking real actions We should adopt a systematic and holistic approach coordinate global actions fully mobilize various resources and strive for more visible outcomes We should enhance practical cooperation to prevent the governance system from lagging behind or being fragmented Colleagues The founding declaration and the Charter of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization made it clear at the outset that we should promote a more democratic just and equitable international political and economic order Over the past years the SCO has adhered faithfully to the Shanghai Spirit of mutual trust mutual benefit equality consultation respect for diversity of civilizations and pursuit of common development We have discussed regional affairs together built platforms and mechanisms together and benefited from cooperation together We have also initiated many new global governance concepts and put them into practice The SCO has increasingly become a catalyst for the development and reform of the global governance system In response to the once in a century transformations unfolding faster across the world the SCO should step up to play a leading role and set an example in carrying out the GGI We should contribute to safeguarding world peace and stability With a vision for common security SCO member states have signed the Treaty on Long Term Good Neighborliness Friendship and Cooperation conducted effective security cooperation and maintained overall stability in the region We should continue to uphold the principles of non alliance non confrontation and not

Emmanuel Levinas intellectual project was to develop a first philosophy Whereas traditionally first philosophy denoted either metaphysics or theology only to be reconceived by Heidegger as fundamental ontology Levinas argued that it is ethics that should be so conceived But rather than formulating an ethical theory Levinas developed his philosophy in opposition to both metaphysics and ontology It takes the form of a description and interpretation of the event of encountering another person Giving rise to spontaneous acts of responsibility for others the encounter unfolds according to Levinas at a precognitive level thanks to what he called our embodied sensibility That is why a phenomenology of intersubjective responsibility would be first philosophy viz in the sense of interpretively reconstructing a level of experience precursive to both reflective activity and practical interests Some commentators have called Levinas work an ethics of ethics others a meta ethics while still others have urged that his thought can accommodate many ethical theories from intuitionism to rationalism see infra However that may be his work is in ongoing critical dialogue with three philosophers Husserl Heidegger and Hegel Given these targets as well as philosophical interlocutors like Merleau Ponty Levinas philosophy begins from an enlarged conception of lived embodiment and a powerful extension of Husserl s technique of suspending conceptualization to reveal experience as it comes to light He is also indebted to Heidegger for his hermeneutics of being in the world Books published posthumously This entry will follow Levinas career chronologically as his concepts evolve In what follows we will emphasize the following arguments and themes why Levinas is a unique first philosophy how he developed his investigation of the lived conditions of possibility of our concern with ethical reasoning and the originality of his adaptation of phenomenology and his existentialist hermeneutics of pre intentional embodied intersubjectivity A leitmotif of this entry is the notion of transcendence in Levinas as we will explain We will pay attention throughout to the contribution of commentators with a view to providing a gateway to recent secondary literature Levinas published his thesis The Theory of Intuition in Husserl s Phenomenology in It was the first book length introduction to Edmund Husserl s thought in French By focusing on the theme of intuition Levinas established what philosophical readers find notably in Husserl s Ideas I and II III published in and for Ideas II III partially in and in different editions in and every human experience is open to phenomenological description every human experience carries meaning from the outset and can be examined as a mode of intentionality Ideas II h and The following year he published his co translation of Husserl s Cartesian Meditations in which Husserl had laid out a systematic presentation of transcendental phenomenology In the s Levinas continued to publish studies of the thought of his two principal teachers Husserl and Martin Heidegger These included the essays Martin Heidegger and Ontology EDE and the extensive The Work of Edmund Husserl DEH In the s and s his philosophical project was influenced by Husserl s phenomenological method whose foundation arguably lay in the centrality of the transcendental ego Ideas I However suspicious of the intellectualism of Husserl s approach to essences called phenomenological eidetics Levinas gravitated toward Heidegger s more worldly approach to existence in Being and Time Between and he will nevertheless turn away from Heidegger s approach to being and transcendence and develop the outlines of a distinct ontology As we shall see he will reconceive transcendence as a need for escape from existence and work out a different analysis of lived time in On Escape Levinas first original essay De l vasion examined the relationship between the embodied sentient self and the intentional ego from the perspectives of physical and affective states including need pleasure shame and nausea In this succinct philosophical work Levinas was less concerned than was Heidegger with the question of existence as it opens up before us when we experience the dissolving of things in the world in anxiety BT Levinas question was not Why is there being instead of simply nothing His concern was to approach existence differently through the human being as Heidegger had also done but in light of more embodied experiences like the above mentioned ones OE Enlarging Heidegger s hermeneutics of being in the world Levinas gave priority to lived moods and physical states that revealed existence as oppressive and indeterminate Indeed in escapism and its various aesthetic expressions we discover humans failed attempts to get away from the being that they themselves are Escape he wrote is the need to get out of oneself that is to break that most radical and unalterably binding of chains the fact that the I moi is oneself soi m me OE In the two imbricated dimensions of human life sentient affective and intentional our experience of being comes to pass in the relationship between body and egoic consciousness Levinas youthful project approached transcendence secularly in light of humans irreducible urge to get past the limits of their physical and social circumstances His transcendence is less a question of cognition reaching reality or humans seeking to pass beyond themselves respectively BT than transcendence attempted through sensuous evasions This approach to transcendence is nevertheless motivated by the question of our mortality and finite being but unlike Heidegger it also examines the enigma called infinity Levinas thus accepted Heidegger s arguments that a human being experiences itself as if thrown into its world BT without cognitive mastery over its birth and death Heidegger s human being or Da sein being there lives out its time projecting itself toward its diverse possibilities It flees its uncanny thrownness by distracting itself in social pursuits a position that Levinas will not adopt On the other hand the projective element of transcendence which Heidegger described in The Basic Problems of Phenomenology as merely a stepping over to as such was of great interest to Levinas But he would enquire to what and from what are we stepping over Levinas then observed M odern sensibility wrestles with problems that indicate the abandonment of this concern with transcendence As if it had the certainty that the idea of the limit could not apply to the existence of what is and as if modern sensibility perceived in being a defect still more profound OE emph added His argument here concerns a conceit of our modern sensibility and philosophy namely that we presume we could thoughtfully frame a better conception of being wherein existence was in some sense self sufficient What Levinas calls the insufficiency of the human condition OE simply denotes the limitation of our existence whose transcendence when understood as escape promises that we might somehow surpass it as if through an infinite experience When transcendence is removed from theological or metaphysical frameworks i e secularized as Heidegger s stepping over then we grasp it in its historical context dependency as the illusions of a finite being pondering pure self sufficiency Reconceived in this way the entire question of transcendence changes revealing the struggle to get out of our all too finite existence That is why Levinas asks Is the need for escape not the exclusive matter of a finite being Would an infinite being have the need to take leave of itself OE In short is our first response to mortality not the urge to take leave of our existence if periodically This question is not so different from Heidegger s conception of inauthenticity But unlike Heidegger true authenticity does not lie in securing our freedom for our most personal possibility death Levinas argued that we can approach death as possibility only through that of others and that we grasp being as finite by way of their mortality On the other hand when secularized the idea of infinity refers to something absolute in human consciousness OE which motivates our repeated efforts at escaping ourselves into various ecstasies This is clearly a conception of being that is different from Heidegger s Later of course Levinas will attribute infinity to a different experience that of the unbounded quality of the face of the other However intersubjective relationality is little discussed in the essay The encounter with the other first comes into view as a theme in his s works TO and EE Significant here nevertheless are the following two points Levinas argument that Heidegger s conception of existence is specific to a history that of German thought and that of hermeneutics to be an embodied psyche is to struggle with the limits of one s facticity or existential situation and it is there that the question of being as our existence initially arises Heidegger s Da sein confronted the question of being when it found itself brought before itself in anxiety BT In contrast Levinas proposed other ways by which the gap narrows between being itself and the beings that we are Following his leitmotif of our recurrent urge to escape Levinas examined the invariable disappointments following our attempts at transcending our existence the aforementioned states of need and pleasure give way to a sobering up or disillusionment In affective and physical states like shame and nausea the bodily self is experienced as a substance trapped in its stifling existence and desperate for a way out Commentator Jacques Rolland has explored Levinas return to the body to concreteness to the desire for escape and the way in which he criticized Heidegger s hermeneutics OE Rolland adds that this approach was inspired by Levinas critical meditation published one year earlier on the blood and soil philosophy popular with National Socialism RPH As regards stifling existence when Levinas refers to being it is as ongoing presence rather than the event of disclosure that Heidegger described It remains a matter of debate whether this interpretation of being constitutes a step back to an older metaphysics prior to Heidegger s innovations or not Franck Whether we choose to take Levinas approach to being as criticizing Heidegger s conception of our existence or as inspired by him commentators often underscore its fresh empiricism Megan Craig compares the early works of Levinas with the radical empiricism of William James xv Lisa Guenther in turn has examined embodiment and the experience of maternity in the later Levinas see From the outset the fact of existing refers to some philosophically unexplored phenomena of our embodiment our aforementioned I self moi soi duality Polemically Levinas urged that the most extreme state he described nausea amounts to being there what Husserl s phenomenology called self positing nausea posits itself not only as something absolute but as the very act of self positing it is the affirmation itself of being OE Other forms of self positing occur of course as this event refers to the experience of unity between the lived corporeal self and the formal ego of intentions In a somewhat different vein Raoul Moati will speak of the first and the third person perspectives Thus in immediate experience I am my joy or my pain provisionally just as I may observe myself joyful like a third person Nevertheless our various efforts to get out of our concrete situations are not the same as what Heidegger deemed projections toward new possibilities wherein our death lies at the end of all the others as the ultimate limit or possibility of impossibility BT For Levinas by contrast escape represents a positive dynamic need In this youthful work he also rethinks need as fullness rather than as mere privation As we indicated he is working toward a different understanding of existence itself Whether it is characterized by pleasure or suffering need is the very ground of that existence A secular transcendence responds to need promising a path toward something other than ourselves OE which is why the deep motivation of need is to get out of our finite condition Already by Levinas ontology has displaced Heidegger s being in light of the dynamic relation between the sentient self and the intentional I it has refocused attention on the present over Heidegger s emphasis on the future and explored new modes by which we experience the being that we are In this youthful essay Levinas discusses three important themes critical for Heidegger If being is disclosed only through the being that we are as humans Da sein then any human being that ongoingly strives to escape itself because it feels trapped in its own daily life can be called a creature that carries the stigmatum of finite existence OE Second nausea is not simply a physiological scourge according to Levinas It shows us dramatically how being can encircle us on all sides to the point of submerging us Social and political life themselves may thereby nauseate us as Rolland observes Third if being or existence is experienced in its pure form as heavy indeterminacy then we can neither bypass it as expressed in the aspirations of Idealism OE nor merely accepted like passive subjects Being is existence but it is firstly our existence The mark of creaturely existence is need and by extension a struggle with being The crucial question that remains is how we can best think through our sensuous need to transcend being Embodied need is not an illusion as we have seen Is transcendence an illusion Levinas answers this question more fully in Totality and Infinity The s writings extend Levinas innovations in ontology always with recourse to interpretations of embodiment and against Heidegger s philosophy of existence which for Levinas entails engagement with being as participation without alterity These writings inflect his notion of transcendence away from the imagined transcendence of evasion and pleasure toward eros and the promise of the birth of a child This requires that he explore alterity understood here as the feminine other EE In Existence and Existents and Time and the Other being now has a dual aspect of light and of dark indeterminacy It is as though being were divided between the being of a created world and the darkness out of which light was brought This shifts phenomenological focus onto being as light and visibility wherein we constitute objects and being as the dark turmoil that we experience in insomnia Levinas attempt to expand the sense of the embodied Da sein and to reconceive the distinction between being and Da sein existence and the perceptual open that we are has also changed Following Husserl s transcendental phenomenology in which a multi layered I directs intentional focus like a center from which our attention radiates Levinas embodied ego is neither preceded nor outstripped by its world The corporeal self soi henceforth called the hypostasis is its own ground i e we awaken out of ourselves into light we proceed with our projects EE TO We fall asleep curled about ourselves thereby exiting our conscious existence Embodied consciousness thus begins and ends with itself As such it is both dependent on and independent from its environment and Levinas will urge that the subject upon awakening uses and masters being In the middle period essays the partial transcendences of pleasure and desire already sketched in receive fuller development and variations The meaning of transcendence focuses on a new temporality promised by desire and fecundity or the birth of the son EE TO The son incarnates alterity in a curious way He is in a sense his father and not his father However his birth opens a different focus on the future No longer conceived as one of open possibilities as Heidegger had argued the time opened by the son responds to two basic limitations on our understanding and representation death and the other person While not denying Heidegger s intuition about death as the possibility of impossibility Levinas repeats his earlier argument that we witness death only in the death of the other But even as such it escapes everyday understanding Hence Levinas will qualify death as an alterity as radical as that of the other human being who confronts me In death the existing of the existent is alienated To be sure the other that is announced does not possess this existing as the subject possesses it its hold over my existing is mysterious It is not unknown but unknowable TO Of course we can and do constitute the other as an alter ego Yet such constitution by phenomenological apperception never exhausts his fundamental difference TO In so arguing Levinas proposes to enlarge Husserl s other of whom the latter said that he or she is an analogon of myself yet also not an analogon in the habitual sense CM Two reversals should be noted here relative to First against Hegel s conception of work as the dialectic of spirit transforming nature Levinas describes labor phenomenologically as effort and fatigue again highlighting his distinction between the embodied working self and the cognitive ego The second reversal concerns moods themselves In Heidegger anxiety joy and boredom were states of mind with anxiety as the privileged mood by which humans are confronted with themselves their lack of ground and with the question of their existence In his middle period Levinas will expand the experience of being to moods now including horror Nighttime being reveals an indeterminate dark presence that is not pure nothing The horror of the night as an experience of the there is does not then reveal to us a danger of death nor even a danger of pain EE Therefore pure being can never be just Heidegger s lighted clearing And our existence in the world requires stronger embodiment than an eye and a hand that reaches to grasp objects ready to hand Heidegger Once again Levinas recurs to bodily states this time including fatigue indolence insomnia and awakening In the first three the aforementioned gap between the embodied self and the intentional I increases Upon awakening the embodied ego soi moi reasserts its mastery over things and even its own bodily torpor But for Levinas being in the world is less a matter of utility and Heidegger s phenomenon of falling into distraction than one of love of life and sheer enjoyment BT This too is part of Levinas critique of Heidegger for whom our concern for the world often coexists with instrumentalist relationships with things In search of variations on being as a call or as revelation and in privileging the basic subjectivity or hypostasis capable of raising itself above being now understood as the neutral there is Levinas is en route to his secular philosophy of alterity and transcendence For further discussion of the middle works see Supplement S on Transcendence and Being Totality and Infinity was written as Levinas Doctorat d tat His concept of transcendence provides us a useful point of departure for reading Totality and Infinity That is so long as we consider his debt to Husserl s phenomenology Husserl understood transcendence in several ways of which one dimension was that typical of consciousness extending toward and encountering the worldly objects noema that offer themselves to it After Husserl Heidegger will define transcendence as the essence of our existing in the world Da sein is always already in the world among things according to a worldly transcendence or being out there Jean Paul Sartre followed Heidegger in this urging that transcendence is a constitutive structure of consciousness EN and his concept of consciousness is similarly in the world and ingredient in our actions For Levinas these senses of transcendence are acceptable but not primary Instead he aligns transcendence with exteriority in the sense of what lies outside myself but eludes my comprehensive knowledge the other person TI The encounter with the other is an encounter with a visible thing of course But this other speaks to me implores or commands me In responding I discover my responsibility to them This is the ground of ethics or indeed our concern with ethics as the good of the other person As Levinas argues when ethics goes in search of its existential ground before any consideration of utility virtue or duty it discovers the relational enactment of responsibility which resists being integrated into accounts in which the other is a universal other to whom it is my duty for example to act ethically or in the hope of increasing the happiness of the collectivity Kant To be sure utility virtue and duty are crucial to ethical debates Yet Levinas is pointing to their common lived origin in the irreducibility of the face to face encounter For a further discussion see Supplement S on Levinas and Contemporary Ethics Totality and Infinity unfolds around phenomenological descriptions of being depicted initially as nature or forces in conflict TI However our being in the world also entails the enjoyment of natural elements and love of life TI We live from good soup air light spectacles work ideas sleep etc These are not objects of representations We live from them TI Levinas also reframes labor as the creation of a store of goods thanks to which the other can be welcomed TI rather than solely as the mastery or humanization of nature Because we take joy in living and in creating a home our existence in the world entails dimensions other than Heidegger s thrown potentiality for Being in the world which is based on Da sein s being abandoned to itself BT Consequently our lives do not consist in an isolated facticity as Heidegger had ventured Life is not the naked will to be an ontological Sorge care for this life Life s relation with the very conditions of its life becomes the nourishment and content of that life TI In being thus nourished we can receive the other into our space On the basis of these descriptions transcendence as defined above comes to pass in several stages First the onset of the other as the expression of the face interrupts our free activity and willing and calls us to account for ourselves TI something Levinas calls goodness TI Second in responding the subject approached by the other engages in an act that opens the possibility of dialogue The unfolding of dialogue expands the social relationship and Levinas argues that social life preserves a residue of the initial ethical encounter with the face Intersubjective dialogue entails conversation teaching and at a more general level literary or philosophical speech TI As we will see this is a dimension of human sociality that often goes unexplored in phenomenologies of intersubjectivity Over the course of the expansion of dialogue the trace of responsibility is attenuated and conundrums arise concerning the well being of others and conflicts within the community These require deliberation about justice and fairness For instance what does justice for the other s mean Should it above all concern the reparation of wrongs Can responsibility for an other coexist with disinterested equity within the community Or is justice in service to the stronger and ultimately opposed to responsibility Now because it can clearly be interpreted as all of these things justice sometimes appears as intermediary between Levinas aforementioned ontology of worldly forces in conflict or elementary being and our acts of responsibility This would tally with Aristotle s two conceptions of justice first as political and second as unbidden decency t epiekes meaning to accept receiving less than one s share Aristotle himself defined the combination of the two as complete virtue Nicomachean Ethics a and b There would thus be an interesting precedent to Levinas question of the relationship between responsibility and justice in Aristotle s virtue ethics Levinas argument in Totality and Infinity unfolds up to the question of justice and then takes an unanticipated tack Rather than pursuing justice as it is refined through civil society into the State Levinas focuses on a smaller scale institution the family which is arguably common to all humanity It is presumably in the family rather than in the State that the responsibility described in the face to face encounter is most clearly enacted If the family is consolidated by the birth of the child then as Levinas puts it it is the father who elects and calls the child to responsibility just as the child grows up serving his siblings in a way more personal than that prescribed by the impersonal justice of States According to Levinas this familial justice carries a specific temporal modalization The unique child as elected one is accordingly at the same time unique and non unique Paternity is produced as an innumerable future as open posterity TI In this penultimate section entitled Beyond the Face the phenomenology of the family thus expands the responsibility experienced in the face to face into a micro society in which questions of justice may arise but with a new emphasis on future time Totality and Infinity does not devote attention to clock time or to the time of universal history in Hegel s sense notably Because Levinas begins his analyses with the concept of being as virtually aligned with material causality and strife the experience of subjective time as the interruption that occurs in the encounter with the face is not yet social time History too seems to be a metaphysician s history In his Preface Levinas describes history as violence punctuated by extremes of war and temporary peace TI Morgan has argued that this makes Levinas approach to ethical intersubjectivity anti naturalistic at least to the degree that naturalism is tied to a Hobbesian mechanistic ontology Levinas would be the last however to deny the self interest of our drives and instincts To the contrary only an intersubjectivity inaugurated by the other s summons interrupts these behaviors Morgan Yet Levinas also envisions an alternative history in which it is possible to bear witness to wrongs undergone by persons These wrongs may not be recorded in the official history of governments But their attestation prolongs his discussion of human sensibility as invested by responsibility Levinas writes h istory is worked over by the ruptures of history in which a judgment is borne upon it When man truly approaches the Other he is uprooted from history TI Levinas phenomenological account of time contains three levels an initial one equivalent to formal historicist time a second level comparable to Husserl s universal flow of immanent time consciousness and a third temporality that is episodic and affectively colored which he calls an interruption The discontinuity of the inner life interrupts historical time notably in the face to face encounter The thesis of the primacy of history constitutes an option for the comprehension of being in which interiority is sacrificed The present work proposes another option TI The aforementioned interruption of our immanent consciousness qua time flow by the other a rupture that Levinas says characterizes our inner life is aligned with the experience of transcendence Unlike Heidegger who explained the subject in terms of Da sein itself an ongoing transcendence toward the world in which Da sein comes toward itself futurally BT in facing the possibility of its death Levinas situates his very concrete transcendence in the interruption of the first two temporal levels Indeed whereas Heidegger gradually translated his conception of the silent call of being in and to Da sein into the notion of the event Ereignis in the s Levinas makes his interruption event an intersubjective affair or rather the basis of ethical relationality For him the encounter with the other is not an ontological event in Heidegger s sense Neither is it like an occurrence that breaks up the historical status quo modifying the course of history into a before and after in function of its magnitude Nevertheless Levinas does argue that the encounter with alterity may leave a trace in historical time Now because the interruption brings to light a basic personal responsibility for an other a host of responses are possible post facto from welcoming that other with hospitality to attempting to get him out of our way Be that as it may a trace of the interruption persists in the subject like a grain of sand in an oyster or a preconscious motivation to bear witness to the other s suffering Jill Stauffer has recovered some of these traces in her research on the testimonies of those deprived of human rights inter alia Fran ois David Sebbah recalls that a memorial trace persists in my experience along with the hope or dream that somewhere I will find other people who may not hear me for the time being but whom I might hope to rejoin this is his version of the ambiguity of hope in the midst of desolation Sebbah a Flowing out of the temporal interruptions that leave affective mnemonic traces in persons the ground of social existence in Levinas does not resemble the solipsism for which Heidegger was criticized Our life with others is never akin to Heidegger s inauthenticity that flight from what should be the resolute assumption of our mortality nor even to moments disappearing in a teleology of expanding socio political collectivities that culminate in the State Hegel sometimes Husserl see Husserl c no As individuals we are always in social relations marked by a remainder of responsibility We have already been impacted by the expression or face of an other Yet because the immediacy of this impact resists conceptualization we tend to overlook the force that the other s address has on us as facial expression or words addressed We carry on in our respective spheres apparently motivated by desires and projects some of which entail the kind of quests for mastery and recognition that Hegel described In Totality and Infinity nevertheless these quests are as if undercut by metaphysical desire TI ff which Levinas defines as a desire for the other that cannot be satisfied As he explains we speak lightly of desires satisfied or of sexual needs or even of moral and religious needs TI However metaphysical desire desires beyond everything that can simply complete it It is like goodness the Desired does not fulfill it but deepens it TI This under layer of our everyday desires comes to light in the faltering of our will to mastery as experienced in the face to face encounter The other s facial expression or bodily posture affects me before I begin to reflect on it As indicated the impact is dual a command and a summons Naked and defenseless the face signifies with or without words Do not kill me It opposes a passive resistance to our desire for mastery wherein our freedom asserts its sovereignty TI Levinas speaks of the face of the other who is widow orphan or stranger While these are Biblical figures he argues that we encounter them concretely even before transcribing them into religious allegory TI They invest our freedom as the possibility of giving It is as summons and injunction that expression precipitates transcendence If I am self sufficient in my everyday activities and perception then this is because I am a being that inhabits overlapping worlds in which my sway is decisive for me The passive resistance of the face alters this sway through an affective mood not unlike one Levinas had explored in On Escape shame In shame we experience our freedom as unjustifiable In thus being lifted out of its concerns the I offers an account to the other who is thereby treated as if higher than that I when considered in its personal sovereignty For that reason as well the I singled out and addressed by the other is chosen or elected to respond TI It transascends TI or rises to the other answering here I am EI As indicated Levinas argues that this instant of election belongs to a temporal order different from that of everyday existence it is the moment of enactment of a good beyond Being TI It is impossible to set up a simple temporal order of succession or alternation between being and the good beyond being For humans the good comes to pass almost trivially and in everyday contexts Of course as readily as responsibility and generosity may be glimpsed in human affairs cruelty and competition are also obvious Given this Levinas seeks support for his intuition about the good in at least two moments in the philosophical tradition wherein its occurrence and irreducible value have been identified Plato s Idea of the good and Descartes infinite substance which points beyond itself to an unknowable cause However that humans experience moments of inexplicable generosity even enact them spontaneously is a fact that would remain enigmatic within an ontology of competing drives or merely utilitarian desires In that respect the trace of the good is present within existence as the possibility that something other than rivalries and instrumentalization take place intersubjectively As Levinas understands it transcendence has the non metaphysical characteristic of an interruption a relation in nuce and what he now calls infinity Insofar as infinity denotes what is non limited uncircumscribable it refers to the unpredictable quality of a face s expression TI As he writes t o think the infinite the transcendent the Stranger is hence not to think an object But to think what does not have the outlines of an object is in reality to do more or better than think TI So far as infinity has a positive sense then it has that sense as our unquenchable desire for sociality Thus before we interpret it as God or reify it as a summum ens the idea of infinity is rooted in an everyday encounter whose implications are clearest at the sensuous affective level and even somewhat resemble Husserl s explorations of spontaneous empathy Einf hlung as expanded in the s notes on intersubjectivity Husserliana Vols Rather than Husserl however Levinas refers to the French phenomenologist Maurice Merleau Ponty s conception of lived intersubjective flesh urging that this corporeal intertwinement is part of our fundamental historicity that is part of the sedimented experiences that contribute to our grasp of new situations Sebbah also emphasizes that the ethical imperative to respond to the command the trial of the other person in no way arises from a psychological process of empathy or of sympathy b In short in intersubjective sensibility is the locus of transcendence outside psychological considerations In the fourteen years separating Existence and Existents and Time and the Other from Totality and Infinity we see both continuities and differences If Heidegger had begun what he conceived to be a hermeneutic dismantling of Husserl s phenomenological consciousness seeking what lies hidden beneath phenomena BT c then Levinas extended this deformalizing gesture already in arguing that light itself is incipient meaning suspending the opposition between the a priori and the a posteriori By it is the experience of the face to face encounter that destabilizes the a priori a posteriori dichotomy by urging that in the face to face the third party humanity looks at me through the eyes of the other This is because the non spatial proximity approach of the other that is the interruption of our flowing time consciousness takes place with an unnoticed spontaneity yet likely leaves a trace That is consciousness always takes up after these instants of interruption and reconnects itself as a homogeneous flow In Existence and Existents Levinas voiced the profound need to leave the climate of Heidegger s philosophy EE By he will have done so albeit not without significantly reworking Heidegger s fundamental ontology As we have seen Levinas envisions being as constant neutral presence and at times like a Hobbesian state of nature Jacques Derrida reminds us that this pre Heideggerian conception is close to Kant s notion of existence understood as intensities in conflict That is why in its natural expression being takes on almost a mechanistic quality in Levinas In political and institutional senses being is conceived as the encompassing of individuals and communities by the State On the latter depend security and property life and death But in the Preface to Totality and Infinity Levinas compares the State with systematic philosophy as the organon of politics the State manages commerce and conflicts just as it declares wars Similarly Hegel s idealist dialectics oversees and integrates sensibility and cognition progressing from the individual to the collective and expressing the movement of Geist or Spirit TI Overall Levinas most sustained criticisms target fundamental ontology As we have seen leaving the atmosphere of Heidegger s thought motivates his return to more traditional conceptions of being To be sure Levinas was skeptical about deriving an ethics from ontology Certainly such an ethics could not limit itself to Heidegger s Mitsein that sociality into which Da sein flees when troubled by its uncanny groundlessness its being thrown into the world Having attempted from onward to carry Heidegger s being there with its states of mind or moods Befindlichkeiten down to more embodied experiences of shame desire hunger and nausea Levinas conviction is that Da sein remains too formal an entity to exist in a world in which human relationality is more substantial than a mere refuge from the anxiety of groundlessness BT Although for Heidegger Angst individuates us and discloses our possibility for the freedom of choosing and taking hold of ourselves BT this process remains solipsistic in the sense that it is our freedom and our mortality that are in question When intensified Angst reveals the groundlessness of our being there ultimately freeing us individually for the question why might there be anything at all Against Heidegger Levinas understands this framing as tantamount to a hermeneutic universe in which the idea of our authentic possibility concerns only our death and underestimates the significance of the encounter with the other person Only through a different hermeneutics which reveals human existence as embodied and interpersonal can we conceptualize the opening to responsibility that the encounter with the other person creates For further discussion see Supplement S on Levinas Hermeneutics Now in Totality and Infinity a further transition occurs from the micro sociality of the face to face encounter to social existence more broadly This is possible thanks to language as teaching and dialogue TI a claim that Merleau Ponty would have approved As indicated earlier on Levinas will open still another path to universalization concerning the whole of humanity through the family in his final section Beyond the Face TI Despite this second path the question remains how it is that for Levinas and through the eyes of the other the whole of humanity looks at me TI Gillian Rose first criticized this limited universalization of responsibility as lacking important socio political mediations Elliot Wolfson has in turn questioned whether this lack is not based on a false dichotomy as both responsibility and socio political mediations are indebted conceptually to a Kantian dualism that neglects the middle Wolfson Ernst Wolff investigated the passage toward universality in light of Levinas evolving conception of liberal society from the latter s skeptical stance toward a more positive appraisal Wolff Finally Elad Lapidot argues that through Levinas hermeneutics of the family we obtain a micro or meta politics wherein the family operates as a counter figure to the state like a collective subject against a total object Lapidot Lapidot adds arguments for a v lkisch influence borrowed here from Heidegger Levinas admits that t he acuity of the problem of universalization lies in the necessity of maintaining the I in the transcendence of the face to face with which it hitherto seemed incompatible given its self interests TI That is although the face to face is a momentary interruption the trace of responsibility needs to be received and assured in a more durable way Thanks to his focus on the family Levinas does provide a partial expansion of responsibility by weaving together the responsibility of the father to his child and the micro sociality of family life in which the trace of interruptive time is historicized This choice works responsibility out in terms one might today consider traditional or patriarchal i e through paternal election and the service of the son to his brothers something that ironically resembles the solidarity through intergenerational love found in Hegel s early theological writings This leads Levinas to assert that the fecundity of the I is its very temporal transcendence TI That is through the time of generations an ego surpasses itself through its children TI Thus even as the time of generations adds something new to being something absolutely new TI i e the child it also provides a partial mediation between the affective instant of responsibility and the creation of institutions and practices apt to ensure that the ethical trace has some potential for extension Rose Derrida and Didier Franck have discussed the difficulty of mediations viz introducing ethics into questions of justice and politics Part of the difficulty lies in the tension between universalization understood as the ethical cultivation of humanity versus universalization understood as providing an ethical inflection to justice broadly conceived For Levinas the passage of responsibility into politics is invariably fragile because ethical language is frequently imitated by political rhetoric Yet in the question of how responsibility and election experienced in the family passes into a vaster history and public space remains under thematized notably as it concerns demands for social justice and equality Herzog has argued that politics in Levinas is firstly defined as concern and care for people s hunger even before it is interest in power or defense of political rights Levinas himself responds by urging that the notion of fraternity is firstly hermeneutic even before it is biological Fraternity is an upshot of intersubjective relations It flows out of face to face encounters and what he calls the human kinship forged by monotheism TI By this Levinas means the ethical core or essence of Judaism As he argues the very status of the human implies fraternity and the idea of the human race Fraternity is radically opposed to the conception of a humanity united by resemblance a multiplicity of diverse families arisen from the stones cast behind by Deucalion and which across the struggle of egoisms results in a human city TI Unification in difference is thus created only when monotheism results in a law that equalizes those obliged by it Levinas similarly traces what he calls originary religion to the face to face following his phenomenological genealogy of it TI Commentators have nevertheless insisted that unless ethics can correct or amend justice on the basis of a subject s experience of responsibility the possibility its expansion remains open to doubt Wolff For many commentators interpersonal responsibility remains the exception not the rule Froese For hermeneutics Hans Georg Gadamer responsibility itself depends on dialogue and established tradition not on the abstract call of the other Responsibility may be subject to codification though that would be the concern of ethical theory which is not Levinas priority Morgan Two dilemmas thus arise in Totality and Infinity It is an open question whether they are laid to rest in Otherwise than Being The first concerns the dichotomy between what was traditionally called free will versus nature the second the aforementioned socio cultural mediations between families and States In the first case it may be surprising that Levinas characterizes human existence in terms resembling those of physiological determinism that is in terms of drives and the interests flowing out of them For him the problem of reconciling freedom and nature would be one of interrupting the activity of the drives which is the bodily substrate of consciousness and which contributes to its dynamic temporal unity Understanding the will then does not begin with freedom so much as with something closer to conatus essendi i e with something natural Levinas proves close to Hobbes and Kant here For the latter the motivation to disregard one s interests in favor of the moral law lies in the affect called Achtung Kant urged that Achtung be considered in its negative and positive aspects negatively as attention or freedom from sensuous distraction In its positive sense Achtung corresponds to reverentia respect understood as the freedom to grasp the law as something eminently worthy of adherence despite its imposed constraint Moreover the presentation of something as the determining basis of our will humbles us in our self consciousness when we compare it with the sensible propensity of our nature Kant KPV Pt I bk I ch AA Nancy Basterra As the focus of attention and motivation Achtung is unique in that it is what Kant calls an intellectual affect Kant KPV AA It has no direct relationship to our bodily make up which as we know also from Levinas is indissociably tied up with drives and instincts When thus motivated practical reason determines itself to act out of respect for a law indemonstrable by theoretical reason Practical reason thereby discovers freedom in the performance of its moral act It is only then post facto that freedom is found to have reality through self obedience Basterra has argued that Kant s ethics affords us an important insight into the question of nature versus freedom in Levinas Whereas for both the will follows its natural course desires and emotions something outside it may compel it toward ethical behavior or responsibility For Kant the categorical imperative does not belong to the self positing subject but rather addresses them as if from without and elicits humility For Levinas it is the face of the other that addresses us this way and focuses our attention prior to our considering that face s empirical qualities sex ethnicity etc Basterra Recently Wenjing Cai has observed that Basterra s arguments for a limited reconciliation between Kant and Levinas produce an otherness or excess within the subject Basterra argues that both the Kantian moral law and Levinas s other indicate an otherness or excess within the subject thereby making the subject of freedom an auto heteronomous one For his part Alexander Altonji argues that Levinas concrete other is not only normative but that the command expressed in the face you shall not kill provides the best answer to the skeptics problem of other minds and other existences Altonji So much for recent debates on Levinas treatment of freedom and nature Let us turn now toward the second dilemma the fraught relationship between ethics and politics In Levinas characterizes politics and drives as unfolding in a similar fashion Both are sites for the manifestation of the will to persist in existence He doubts that politics when left to itself can long remain ethical TI Wolff However he remarks that justice can be addressed as an ethical demand posed to some States notably liberal ones This does not solve the problem of mediations yet suggests that Rose s Hegelian objection may be misguided After all what do the mediations ultimately serve if not the finality of the State as overarching protector and regulator Levinas was aware of this In in his first published article on the State of Israel he did not hesitate to forestall accusations of idolatry even against a Jewish State Arguing philosophically that the State is not an idol because it precisely permits full self consciousness he added that modern humans acknowledge their spiritual nature when acting in the service of the State and in their dignity as citizens This is indeed why he added the decline of organized religions is tied to the advent of modern States Here and elsewhere he recognized that a State and preeminently one founded on a religion embodied a paradox whose solution in Israel s case at least could only be found in an approach to religion as the symbolic pendant of ethical responsibility DF He thereupon added the more existential claim that the Jewish people craved their own land and their own State not because of the abstract independence which they desired but because they could then finally begin the work of their lives DF Clearly this is not an exhaustive solution to the problem of mediations between family or ethnicity and the State or politics We will return to this question in section For a discussion of other commentators see Supplement S on Commentators on Levinas Politics Otherwise than Being grew up around its core fourth chapter entitled Substitution and first published in OBBE also see Bernasconi see further Simon Critchley It is a justifiable simplification to say that Levinas concept of substitution corresponds to that of responsibility explored this time as relationality in immanence rather than as my response to the face understood as exteriority In this work Levinas uses the term int riorit repeatedly which the translator renders as inwardness perhaps to avoid introducing spatial binaries OBBE The work is not about inner outer dichotomies much less cognitive operations or memories of events or things It has little to do with the phenomenological discoveries emerging through what Husserl called making present Vergegenw rtigung Inwardness denotes a bodily life as if haunted by others which is also now called proximity OBBE Sebbah b n Comparable in this to Husserl s horizon of apperceptions inwardness entails a spectrum of affective tones Unlike Husserl however these tones require recourse to discursive figures that Levinas now borrows from psychology poetics hermeneutics even theology and dogmatics e g obsession persecution recurrence too tight in its skin exile maternity love and finally expiation and kenosis While thus concerned with intersubjective affectivity in its immediate passive undergoing substitution is manifest in human practice the domain in which we experience immediacy By then transcendence understood as the other outside me has become transcendence in immanence in a sense closer to Merleau Ponty s account of intercorporeity which similarly urged that philosophies of embodiment should never oppose the terms immanence and transcendence PP For Levinas the concept of the other would still refer to the face as expression and exteriority but it would denote principally the inwardness of memories that are not about objects yet whose affective return or recurrence further complexifies the linear time schema of Husserl s early phenomenological consciousness OBBE This insistence on living presence and practice which represent Levinas resistance to objectification can also be found today in phenomenologies that underscore the difference between a third person perspective and a first person one Sebbah a has argued this point in light of what he calls an ethics of the survivor Some have objected that Levinas late work reflected a certain survivor s guilt Sebbah takes up this charge resolutely emphasizing that in Levinas philosophy the dead those who did not survive are not phantoms or even traces confined in archival documents At the pre reflective level they do not belong to the world or to an economy of being so much as they carry on as affective saliences persisting unremarked in our intersubjective relations Hence preserving traces without life i e without a living face or even more in enclosing them within the horizon of the World like tools among tools or again in enclosing them within re presentation through memory ultimately comes down to endangering the authentic living relation to the other According to Sebbah only the lived immediacy of the face to face holds the ontological order metaphorically open to transcendence This first person perspective is a theme that goes back to Maimonides negative theological critique of human language in light of the divine attributes of practice In short transcendence expressed as the Good is an old theme in Judaism Levinas adapts it to his hermeneutic phenomenology and by the immediacy of the face to face will be extended into the immanence of lived memory even as these affective memories condition our interactions with others Otherwise than Being opens with a general overview of the argument in which being and transcendence are also named essence and disinterest Emphasizing the processual quality of being Levinas will refer to it equivalently as being or essence venturing that he might even have used the dynamic form essance OBBE note Responsibility will be focused and discussed as the condition of possibility of all verbal signification OBBE Totality and Infinity s themes of conversation and teaching thus recede into the background Levinas now makes a more strategic use of the body as flesh that is as a locus with simultaneously an inside and an outside as in Merleau Ponty Subjectivity is again framed affectively as the coming to pass of responsibility although this time the phenomenological approach to intentionality is analyzed into its basic layer of sensibility that Levinas calls pre originary susceptiveness susception pr originaire OBBE For him that means that subjectivity always entails pre cognitive dimensions that are from the outset intersubjectively conditioned The other has become other in the same as indicated To be sure the other in the same is not objectively different from the factical other who faces me because neither one is an object and both are expressions or modes of alterity As we will see the other in the same describes a pre thematic call or investiture indeed I never know when I first experienced this other in me OBBE Levinas adopts the middle voice of passivity activity here All my inwardness is invested s investit in the form of a despite me for another OBBE Thus in Otherwise than Being Levinas has returned to Husserl s inquiries into passive synthesis to the latter s perplexities about the stretching of our retentions of experiences about the unbidden spontaneity of our associations and the near infinity of sensuous horizons all part of a process unfolding passively in what Husserl called in a phenomenology of the so called unconscious In light of this return we should not approach interiority and exteriority as opposed terms but as felt dimensions of intersubjectivity and the inhabitation of a self by alterity The second chapter approaches Heidegger s discussion of language as the way in which being becomes the way it temporalizes BT b Levinas revisits Heidegger s argument that the logos gathers up being and makes possible being s unveiling al theia He will argue that the lapse of time between lived immediacy and its reflective representation is never fully gathered by the logos Therefore the temporal lapse poses a challenge to language understood as Heidegger s gathering It falls much the way that transcendence as interruption did in outside the realm of being as gathering even though Levinas still considers being and language as processes of totalization as an all encompassing system His rethinking of the lapse with transcendence in immanence will be Levinas ultimate modification of Heidegger s project Together the lapse and this new conception of transcendence do ultimately pass through language albeit as practice as words addressed to someone I will come back to this For now suffice it to say that it is the inhabitation of a self by alterity that forms the sensuous conditions of possibility of speech Thus it is not being that addresses us through language it is quite different it is human alterity Two additional innovations in Otherwise than Being include Indeed prior to spoken or written language prior to signs reciprocally exchanged we suppose that there is in the transcendence involved in language a relationship that is not empirical speech but responsibility OBBE Levinas calls this theme inspired by Franz Rosenzweig s Stammwort root word my pre originary susceptiveness In Levinas the nature of intersubjective sensibility shares its time structure with strong passions sometimes indeed with trauma OBBE As Levinas writes this susceptiveness describes the suffering and vulnerability of the sensuous as the other in me T he ipseity also known as embodied selfhood has become at odds with itself in its return to itself The self accusation of remorse gnaws away at the closed and firm core of consciousness fissioning it in its temporal unity OBBE Consequently vulnerability and sensitivity to trauma not only provoke retreat into self but heighten our awareness however tenuous of our connection with the other Thereupon they motivate verbal address and ultimately bearing witness Thus the affective in habitation of my self by an other precedes formal speech acts and speech communities If the reverse were the case that is if a sociological community were posited as prior to the event of the address then this would presuppose what it was meant to show the affective genesis of speech acts OBBE In other words beneath words proffered lies a fundamental vulnerability that psychology might interpret as a tendency to witnessing from oneself to the other Levinas calls this vulnerability the Saying OBBE It is the condition of possibility of words uttered in the form of response i e pre linguistic and it accompanies communication like its affective horizon The duality of Saying and Said or words uttered is a new concept in Levinas late work Building on the exploration of proximity begun in chapter three chapters four and five evince a tone more somber than any found hitherto in Levinas uvre This is in keeping with the dedications of the book written in Hebrew and in French which announce that it will be a work of mourning While Derrida characterized Totality and Infinity as a phenomenology of hospitality Derrida Otherwise than Being commemorates the victims of the hatred of the other man It develops the parallel between semiotic substitution of a word for a thing the signifying function of all language and the affective substitution of myself for an other extended through a spectrum of acts of self sacrifice from daily empathy to interventions enacted for the other This is what Levinas calls the one for the other OBBE Whereas Heidegger had explored the hermeneutics of Da sein for whom communication unfolds thanks to our as Da sein taking or equivalently offering this thing or word as that thing BT Levinas will arguably set Heidegger s as into his for Heidegger s this as that becomes Levinas one for the other of substitution While responsibility expressed the unfolding of the intersubjective affects that Levinas compared to Plato s Good beyond Being in TI the good of substitution is more ambiguous occurring on the brink of tears and laughter OBBE yet also glorious OBBE The experience of time characteristic of trauma and mourning does not take the place of Husserlian phenomenology s flowing time consciousness any more than it replaces the succession and uninterruptedness of clock time If what is results from the self giving of things to the focus of phenomenological attention and if together they invariably find a place in the formal flow of time consciousness then even for Husserl what is i e being temporalizes as consciousness Husserl had always urged that insofar as there is appearing there is an indication of being CM also see Heidegger BT For Heidegger being temporalizes through Da sein which is out ahead of itself or oriented toward its future Yet if in both their cases being unfolds temporally then for Levinas our sensibility shows a different temporal character because the sensibility called the other in the same returns and repeats rather than flows In its new somber tones as trauma and mourning responsibility recurs without definitively halting the flow of time consciousness This is why Levinas referred to the cluster of concepts around substitution as adverbial they inflect or modalize being understood as processual and its time thereby temporarily modifying it Indeed when being is understood as the verbal dynamism expressed by essence then responsibility and substitution can only be compared to ad verbs Hence the title autrement other wise than being which itself is an adverb OBBE This is a kind of wager it does not abrogate the ontological character of existence rather it suggests inflections of it The final half of chapter five recurs to the performative register of language It seeks to convey the tension of a consciousness striving to consolidate itself in the wake of alterity as affective investiture by which its passivity slowly becomes active witnessing This opening out of inward affects becoming gestures of generosity motivates Otherwise than Being s recourse to the new performative language Levinas adds and I still interrupt the ultimate discourse in which all the discourses are stated in saying it to one that listens That is true of the discussion I am elaborating at this very moment OBBE see Derrida s commentary on this He is no doubt aware of the seemingly artificial quality of calling his authorial witness immediate But Levinas claim is more than a literary artifice Basterra compares it to Kant s idea of autonomy which shows itself only when we follow a law that exceeds and addresses the subject motivating its ethical act Basterra Earlier in her above mentioned study she had argued that the intellectual affect of Achtung was capable of focusing our attention and opening us to a respect comparable to Levinas Saying which he also calls sincerity For pure reason autonomy is therefore an illusion but it is one only insofar as that which is not intrinsically part of my interests can still motivate me to act Thus pure reason erroneously supposes that my ethical gesture came from me Basterra Levinas provides us a crucial hermeneutics of the intersubjective origin of this illusion denounced in the first Critique He sets the heteronomy of Kant s practical reason into a hermeneutic register referring to the sincerity underlying the words we offer It is in the risky uncovering of oneself in sincerity the breaking up of inwardness exposure to traumas vulnerability that I bear witness to and for another OBBE Again this does not come from us It arises from being faced by an other and it persists as affective memory in our lived body Indeed when asked Levinas finds illustrations of such witnessing in many places from the justice imperative of the Biblical prophets to the concern of Latin American clerics over the events unfolding in Chile in OGCM As in his discussion of need and nausea Levinas argues in Otherwise than Being that lived sensibility often overflows representations of it And again he proposes sensuous modes different from Heidegger s Befindlichkeiten see supra in which all understanding takes place for him BT Indeed interwoven layers of affectivity are unfolded in Otherwise than Being Levinas explores the sensuous affective proto experience of the other in light of new moods writing Remorse is the trope of the literal sense of sensibility In its passivity is erased the distinction between being accused and accusing oneself OBBE Unlike Existence and Existents wherein light overcomes the distinction between subjects and objects allowing the subject to make an object intelligible for itself within the horizon of its appearing EE Otherwise than Being approaches transcendence in sensuous and temporal terms arguing for the insistence of a past that eludes thematization what he calls the immemorial OBBE Transcendence for an embodied being would always thus be transcendence in immanence The affective experience of my relations with particular others is preserved as a trace or pre thematic reminiscence of the flesh as a relationship with a singularity without the mediation of any principle any ideality OBBE Invoking Otherwise than Being OBBE John Llewelyn called this affective dimension of invested selfhood or ipseity a deep saying that bears witness to what is neither recollected nor forgotten in the epistemic sense of these terms when or once it is represented as a sign Llewelyn As indicated Otherwise than Being problematizes Levinas earlier more ontological approach in Totality and Infinity He proceeds now on the basis of Husserl s inquiries into passive syntheses notes on intersubjectivity and Einf hlung empathy There is good reason for this Responsibility denoted an event that repeats and even intensifies as it is assumed already TI In Otherwise than Being however the question of immanence and passivity arises in regard to responsibility s unremarked persistence and its affective upwellings in us This is because the status of a memory of sensuous events which may have affected us outside of any representation we form is elusive For the phenomenologist it might correspond to an apperception or horizon in the sense of something that conditions perception but is not directly perceived Thus Levinas also insists that unlike the apperceptions Husserl explored thanks to the reduction he set on memory this affective past continues to escape thematization because it was never intentional at all and because memories of our lived flesh precede the consolidation of our ego OBBE John Drabinski has explored this pre history in light of Levinas reprise of genetic phenomenology Theodor de Boer approaches it as an echo of both Rosenzweig and Jewish prophetism Sebbah a argues that the subject of such trials must be the witness he argues that Levinas proposes a unique epoch through which to approach affective vulnerability Levinas is aware that a counter temporality of the affects is open to critique He even reminds us that skepticism even that concerning his hermeneutic wager obeys an ethical imperative to deconstruct philosophy and with it all totalizing discourses whether they are logical or political OBBE Unlike Husserl Levinas does not theorize a system consisting of levels of drives and affects intentionalized by higher egoic acts He does exploit however a difficulty that beset Husserl s early eidetic phenomenology The difficulty concerns bodily sensation in relation to the flow of intentionality as discussed by Husserl in Appendix of his lectures on inner time consciousness PCIT For Husserl in order to be experienced sensation had to be intentional Whereas ever for him the bodily origins of intentionality were the concern of physiological psychology he recognized that the ongoing alterations in the body accounted for our feeling of temporal progression In short as they intentionalized sensuous changes were in fact responsible for the experience of the flow of inner time the same flow precisely that conferred temporal order upon conscious sensations Phenomenology thereby remained consistent with itself as the eidetics of consciousness But it did so at the price of disregarding preconscious processes like what Husserl later called affektive Kr fte affective forces that would only be explored later in phenomenology s genetic period starting around Levinas first addressed Husserl s difficulty in his essay Intentionality and Sensation DEH Intentionalizing sensation was he said t he original mark of Husserlian idealism DEH Unlike Husserl who addressed the problem with his speculative use of concepts like affective forces affektive Kr fte Levinas developed his conception of diachrony OBBE that is the sensuous interruption that he equated with transcendence in immanence Levinas focused on the gap i e diachrony between bodily sensation entering intentionality and sensation as pre conscious processes occurring at the intersubjective level Levinas thus compared the duality of sensibility as conscious and preconscious to his idea of a pre intentional receptivity of an other penetrating into the same in sum into our intersubjective life and not into thought DEH This sensuous alterity will support two important claims i e that intersubjective affects overflow the framework of representational consciousness and that affective interruptions can obtrude on the even flow of time consciousness Similarly Sophie Veulemans has compared Levinas diachrony with Bergson s approach to the new sensuous modification in the midst of duration Veulemans Rudolf Bernet in turn equates the newness of the phenomenological instant with the root of all alterity and all difference in Levinas This allows Bernet to urge that the intersubjective investiture of the subject will always prove unthinkable in a philosophy of consciousness Bernet also see OBBE Following his argument classical phenomenology would not have adequately thought through the sensuous way in which the other liberates the subject from its captivity within its own immanence Bernet Otherwise than Being involves an innovative discussion of signification Given Levinas hermeneutic insight that language is not merely a system of words paired up with pre existing objective realities but instead brings reality to light language and time will have analogous functions That is both make meaning possible as the realization of ourselves in the world Indeed while Heidegger had argued that being resonates in poetic language as the verb to be Levinas counter argued for an otherwise than being that glimmered in ad verbial meaning opening to transcendence Yet if the relationship between language and being is fully encompassing as it is for Heidegger then either Levinas otherwise than being looks like mere speculation or it simply inheres in being or participates in its verb like dynamism Either way fundamental ontology thereby proves primordial and weakens Levinas claims That being said for him the transcendence indicated by the adverbial points toward a temporality that differs both from the flow of time consciousness as theorized by Husserl and from the self temporalization characteristic of Da sein in Heidegger i e as out ahead of itself toward its ownmost possibility OBBE The lapse of time between the pre intentional sensuous moment and its intentionalization in consciousness corresponds to what Levinas calls the Saying OBBE the condition of possibility of words addressed His discussion of the Saying correlates with his treatment of sincerity introduced already in Existence and Existents Otherwise than Being radicalizes this notion insisting that the structure of sensibility is always as if punctuated by sensuous lapses It is thanks to such temporal lapses that we are open and able to communicate because as we have seen proximity is an affective mode that motivates dialogue While all sensuous lapses are not necessarily openings to intersubjective relationality proximity and vulnerability are the loci of transcendence in immanence and the birth of signification whether words are actually uttered or not For Levinas there is more in living affectivity than in what Heidegger s conception of being speaking through language had captured This becomes clear the moment we understand signification originally as an affective pre intentionality and not as some thought already formulated that the I thereupon chooses to communicate to an other OBBE Levinas thus conceives language as more than denotation and description Already verbs escape the coupling of words with things that we find in the case of the noun In the verb of apophansis predication which is the verb properly so called i e the verb to be essence resounds and is heard OBBE Red reddens without requiring conversion into propositions sounds resound in music and poetry Nevertheless a verb can be converted into a noun thereby losing its processual quality Through the ambiguousness of the logos the verb par excellence being in which essence resounds is nominalized becomes a word designating and sanctioning identities assembling time into a conjuncture or situation OBBE Hence even the verbality or event like quality of being can take on a nominal form such as in a being Levinas calls this convertibility the amphibology of being and entities beings OBBE While this reciprocal reference expresses the danger of taking being for a thing a danger about which Heidegger warned us what Levinas calls the amphibology neglects a unique aspect of some verbs their reflexive quality Thus verbs like se dire understood as to say but in a reflexive sense are determined by the se or self as though one were thereby saying oneself self communicating Levinas now sets his ethical hermeneutic reduction on the reflexive particle se urging that although being speaks through the logos the se points toward a mode of our embodied sensuous passivity OBBE In short Levinas accepts the Heideggerian claim about being expressing itself through language but he adds the observation that reflexive verbs bespeak a subjective giving that is not found in verbs transitive or intransitive The se is not itself a verb it corresponds to the passive pre condition of communication the way a self would also do This passivity is enigmatic because the se is neither a verb nor even a noun it is considered a particle or a reflexive pronoun Yet this particle is indispensable to the middle voice of a host of verbs in many Latin languages It is thanks to its enigmatic function that our subjective vulnerability to the other grounds the dynamics of words said to that other To this reflexive se corresponds our passivity as it comes to light in the temporal lapse called diachrony Diachrony thereby expresses our sincerity toward the other and transcendence understood in a practical sense T he spirit hears the echo of the otherwise OBBE in the words we offer and perform and thus not merely as the words we offer With the adverb otherwise a modalization of fleshly investiture momentarily escapes the nominalization available to many verbs including that of being i e between being and a being As indicated we find here the practical sense of transcendence which Levinas compares with Merleau Ponty s fundamental historicity those unremarked passive bodily sedimentations that make up our selfhood OBBE Levinas later work notably Otherwise than Being has been characterized as hermeneutical Focusing on the discussions of the other in the same and passivity in that work commentator Giuseppe Lissa provides an apt description of Levinas interpretive project By investigating the depths of consciousness by comparing its passivity to the process of ageing Levinas investigates a reality unknowable but perhaps interpretable by a thinking that no longer claims to be an exercise in knowledge because this thinking is engaged in the search for a meaning that precedes all knowledge Lissa concludes that Levinas intimates a meaning that in preceding knowledge founds it orients it and to some degree justifies it Lissa For him Levinas turn to hermeneutics largely dates from his abandonment of the phenomenology of exteriority as the subtitle of Totality and Infinity indicates An Essay on Exteriority As we have seen insofar as the search for meaning underlying all manner of intentional constitution and other modes of intentionality presupposes a meaning only incipiently grasped something that corresponds to Heidegger s rethinking of hermeneutics in light of Da sein s basic understanding Levinas appears to owe a debt to two forms of hermeneutic practice On the one hand to Heidegger s existential hermeneutics on the other to a much older polyphonic practice of reading This is Talmudic thought interpretively elaborating Jewish law Halakhah and recounting and parsing narratives Aggadah Lapidot refers to this dualism as an inter epistemic divide which is sometimes carried in philosophy as an inner philosophical drama According to Lapidot this divide between Athens and Jerusalem is fecund as it permits Levinas to mobilize Jewish traditions to interrupt the tendency of systematic epistemology to conceptualize the world cf ontological imperialism as Lapidot writes citing Totality and Infinity To be sure a significant difference between this hermeneutics and that of Christian theology lies in its giving less weight to philosophical justifications of faith Let us turn briefly to this hermeneutics Levinas presented twenty three Talmudic readings in the context of the Colloques des intellectuels juifs de langue fran aise Ethan Kleinberg has recently discussed four of these readings with acute attention to the growth of Jewish themes in Levinas philosophical project Kleinberg It bears noting that in at the first meeting of the colloquium Levinas merely participated in the debates Salomon Malka reminds us of one of his profoundly hermeneutic observations around that time Judaism is not a religion the word doesn t exist in Hebrew it is much more than that it is an understanding of being The Jews introduced into history the idea of hope and that of a future Moreover Jews have the sentiment that their obligations toward the other person come before their obligations in regard to God Malka my trans emph added This remark already shows us three important things First that Judaism might be an understanding of being implies that it can encompasse ontology Second that Judaism was profoundly aware of finitude as both precarity and mortality By extension the hermeneutic life of Jewish traditions is an unfinished ongoing process Third that our obligations to other persons come before duties toward God from rituals to norms and occasionally abrogate these duties denotes a secularizing lan or better a human oriented dimension within Judaism This helps us grasp how it is that Levinas found resources in Heidegger s hermeneutics both utilizing and criticizing its concepts and method The relationship between Levinas thought its Jewish influences and phenomenological philosophy has given rise to multiple evaluations Martin Kavka argues that Levinas understood both Judaism and Western philosophy as engaging in structurally similar forms of thinking Kavka He situates the structural similarity in that both these intellectual corpuses consist of texts that point to what cannot be brought to presence and consequently work between the dimensions of reference explanation and hermeneutic pre comprehension cf Ouaknin To be sure for European philosophy the transcendence of the Good is often integrated into epistemological projects e g Descartes Against Kavka s claim Lapidot emphasizes foundational differences a method that departs decisively from vision based objectifying thought reveal s it as implanted in a forgotten experience from which it lives Moreover a foundation in axiology or a thinking of relational values is a notable Jewish contribution to philosophies of language and intersubjectivity However this foundation arises first as voice as teaching That means that the tradition unfolds around the auditory register rather than the visual one the way I carry a voice within me as opposed to constituting something visually at a distance Kavka and Michael Fagenblat certainly recognize the profound historicity of this dimension of Jewish thought indeed it is not clear that a new direction in Jewish philosophy is ever really new Kavka Fagenblat examines the hermeneutic extension that Otherwise than Being gives to Totality and Infinity and both commentators argue that Levinas increasingly critical stance toward the epistemological and foundationalist aspects of Husserlian phenomenology motivated him to expand his hermeneutic recourse both to Heidegger s Existenzphilosophie and toward Jewish thought including Neo Platonic currents and Maimonides Fagenblat But it should be emphasized that Levinas hermeneutics begins well before Otherwise than Being His reinterpretation of being in the world the meaning of facticity the creation of a dwelling and even his reading of eros and the family in entail interpretive choices indebted to at least two significant hermeneutic themes Heidegger s interpretation of our pre comprehension of existence and Rosenzweig s approach to Jewish life in The Star of Redemption SE In Levinas wrote that Rosenzweig s Star of Redemption was too often present in this book Totality and Infinity to be cited TI and numerous are the commentaries on the presence of Rosenzweig in Levinas work It is important to recall that Rosenzweig had been a scholar of Hegel until the experience of the trenches in World War I motivated his substituting the limited community forged by Sprachdenken for Hegel s idealist political philosophy universalizing dialectics gave way to an existential relationality that preserved singularity through dialogue The Star of Redemption is a complex work analyzing the lived times of Jews and Christians with a view to conceiving a certain extension of Judaism via Christianity over the course of their histories At the core of each one lay a task and a profound if disparate intuition a Sprachdenken dialogical thinking engendered by a revelation Peter Eli Gordon has argued that Rosenzweig is a post Nietzschean philosopher a post death of God thinker who thereby opened this God to relationality however enigmatic Gordon observes that like Heidegger Rosenzweig s new thinking denies that human meaning is intelligible independent of a life and other context Temporal hermeneutics thus replaces the transcendental search for essence Gordon The same could be said of Levinas Since he conceives temporality in human terms as opposed to eternity or stasis meaning itself can only be approached in light of time Readers familiar with Rosenzweig s neues Denken may know that he situated one of the principal hermeneutic differences between Judaism and Christianity in the way their theologies temporalized with Christianity being oriented around the life and death of the incarnate God an event whose occurrence lies in the historic past and Judaism as historically future oriented i e ongoingly awaiting the messiah Levinas took up the question of meaning and temporality in a way somewhat different from both Rosenzweig and Heidegger In as we have seen his phenomenology of hospitality proceeded on the present time of love of life in the world and the momentary encounter called the face to face However the place where he explicitly uses the term phenomenology therein concerns precisely a secularized messianic future This is the chapter entitled Phenomenology of Eros which deploys a phenomenological model for the ultimate term of our desire as Fagenblat puts it To this Lapidot adds the family flowing out of eros would be beyond the finite individual the infinite individual being the ultimate structure of being produced as multiple and as split into Same and Other TI this would be the we of the family Lapidot The argument would be this before eros is sublimated in civil society eros and the family bring to light our concern with others in their particularity and difference independently of their biological or social roles We can take the family as a model here in the Frankfurt School s sense of an intellectual construction whose elements are borrowed from empirical experiences that have already shown their worth Broch The phenomenology of eros opens a future of election within the family and perhaps beyond it Despite the apparent heterosexism of his formulations Levinas introduces an abiding concern for singularity and uniqueness by defining the figure of paternity as the possibility of electing each son in his specificity just as the latter may serve and clash with his brothers Consistent with a model the family is both figure and reality It serves Levinas hermeneutic secularization of messianic future time inspired by Rosenzweig through the succession of generations Interestingly eros unfolds phenomenologically in much the same way eas did the proto experience of the there is il y a That is it unfolds in a darkness overlooked by phenomenologies that rely on light and the universal evidence that light enables TI There would consequently be a neglected underside to the phenomenological account of constitution which precedes and accompanies intentionality s encounter with objects and world And that requires hermeneutics as Moati observes in Levinas and the Night of Being For further discussion of Jewish hermeneutics see Supplement S on Hermeneutics and Jewish Philosophy Like Fagenblat scholars from David Banon to Marc Alain Ouaknin to Sebbah have explored the hermeneutic dimension of Levinas thought even beyond his Talmudic readings that delve into the many voiced debates between the rabbis of the Mishnah and the Gemara the oldest and subsequent transcriptions of Jewish oral traditions Banon As Ouaknin points out in the case of Talmudic and Biblical hermeneutics Levinas always considered the eminence of a book what defines it as the Book to be less its themes than its structure Levinas focuses on the structure of the Book of books inasmuch as it allows for exegesis hermeneutics and on its unique status of containing more than it contains Hermeneutics is thus engendered by excesses of potential meaning over senses already printed on the page or even discerned by the reception traditions of the work It would thus be the specific architecture of the book that conditions its reception Moreover the parallelisms that we have seen between the Saying and the Said and between temporal diachrony and synchrony are also found at the literary level in Biblical and Talmudic texts with their openness to ongoing interpretation Levinas even equates revelation with the call of the text to each reader or listener who thereby becomes responsible for its interpretation The Revelation as calling to the unique within me is the significance particular to the signifying of the Revelation of the text which is understood as dialogical to its core Here we see the structural analogy between the call of the other and my response that begins as Saying as opening to words addressed Levinas adds the totality of the true is constituted from the contribution of multiple people the uniqueness of each act of listening carrying the secret of the text the voice of the Revelation as inflected by each person s ear would be necessary to the Whole of the truth BTV Hermeneutic truth here becomes the responsibility of an open community as much as an invitation to participation extended to each possible listener That is why Levinas could urge that Scripture be understood as summoning the reader to respond as readily as the subject was called to respond i e through situations of responsibility All of these express an ethical investiture that results in words offered The here and now of scriptural voices and reading stands analogous to the here and now of the face to face encounter and the fact that memory occurs by definition in the present Levinas hermeneutics might nevertheless be deemed immanent i e concerning one book and one community Although commentators like Leora Batnitzky find in Levinas a project for a modern politics and thus for universality others are skeptical about her claim Trigano objects that Levinas ethics unfolds out of a sort of non site starting with the category of the singular For Levinas he argues it is ethically imperative to think the singular in order that the horizon of the other person arise The universal is in effect a dangerous game that can lead to totality and to the negation of the other person To decide in favor of the singular is to avoid such a development and with it a closed politics Trigano Froese argues that we can derive a utopian politics from Levinas hermeneutics provided that we understand the levels of subjectivity he explores including the affective and pre conscious level in which original intersubjectivity is born This requires mobilizing a genetic phenomenological method And perhaps for that reason it has been largely missed by left and liberal readers who see in Levinas a pure ideological fantasy Froese one that readily aligns with neoliberalism As Froese insists however the social bond between subjects is not predicated on a common experience or shared horizon of meaning but simply on the experience of the self as a self is necessarily mediated in and through others Without this understanding there is little way to mobilize Levinas philosophy as a critique of politics In sum the hermeneutic and phenomenological turn that Levinas gives to Husserl and Heidegger has led to debates about the relationship between an immanent hermeneutics and one concerned with politics as the sphere of the universal Herzog argues in the same vein as Froese for a Jewish and Levinasian universalism provided we accept her thesis that ethics and politics mutually interrupt each other with ethics urging us toward a surplus of responsibility and politics representing the inescapable context and risk that besets responsibility To demonstrate her claim Herzog engages an extensive study of the politics of the law as debated in the Talmud and presented in Levinas Talmudic readings Herzog These questions imply discussions about politics in our time from which Levinas might have refrained in his time in the wake of the Shoah when politics seemed less important than questions of the future of Jewish communities Be that as it may even objections that claim to be phenomenological and not ideological Drabinski fail to emphasize that phenomenology itself contains a Cartesian egology with transcendental and lifeworld egoic layers as well as a psychological level derived from the embodied experience of affectivity including intersubjective affects Much of the debate about Levinas politics unfolded successively in France and then in the English speaking world Michel Haar asked of Levinas whether his ethics could really unfold outside of any site outside of any positive reciprocity and outside all objectivation cited by Trigano note Trigano criticized Levinas urging that the dialectical relationship between singular experience and universal meaning and institutions implies that philosophy should have a minimal relationship to politics Trigano On Trigano s account it follows that Levinas hermeneutics only partly responded to Jews post war need for the universalization of their experience at a human level encompassing both theory and political practice Trigano This does not contradict Batnitzky s reading which considers Levinas uvre as a whole But it can be argued that universalization in Levinas ethics remains largely formal On this question turns the important matter of what it means to develop a Jewish philosophy today Numerous are the objections to what we could call Levinas genetic hermeneutics Terry Eagleton Slavoj i ek and Simon Critchley among others have read Levinas as though the face to face encounter represented a retreat into private life without reference to or concern for social and political existence Froese speaks by contrast in terms of entanglement echoing Levinas own arguments that the social structural dimension of our relationship to alterity is itself impoverished when we neglect the pre subjective plane of analysis made possible through genetic phenomenology Sebbah a also emphasizes Levinas hermeneutic argument for the separation that defines the subject in the world this must be taken seriously throughout Stated otherwise the subject is in the world yet not wholly of the world the true interiority is nothing of the world and certainly not as an inside that would be situatable in that world Hope and responsibility when nothing of the world remains standing or only remains standing in the crude light of wretchedness resist because they are neither of the world nor of being Hope and responsibility whereby in a sense interiority is evasion or escape itself Sebbah a Derrida once called Totality and Infinity a treatise on hospitality As we have seen Levinas work approached being as the conflict of wills that persist in their existence like the philosophical tradition s concept of conatus essendi the will to persist in being Neutral existence or the there is il y a denoted indeterminate nocturnal being which gives way to the diurnal being called the elemental sunlight winds rain As noted being in Levinas thus entails both dynamic forces and a conception of natural processes Hospitality also called metaphysical desire TI cannot be grounded on such forces much less on a conception of the will whether based on drives of self preservation or self enhancement And because hospitality is elicited by the other and is non reciprocal it does not presuppose a prior social contractual exchange much less moral sentiments or innate emotive capacities for empathy or compassion If it did there would be no question of escaping a so called natural order of existence That is why Levinas aware that the concept of nature itself has a debated history characterizes our response to the other which by is also called pre natural signification OBBE He now argues in phenomenological terms i n renouncing intentionality as a guiding thread toward the eidos formal structure of the psyche our analysis will follow sensibility in its pre natural signification to the maternal where in proximity to what is not itself signification signifies before it gets bent into perseverance in being in the midst of a Nature OBBE emph added The maternal here is a figure for the affective experience of bearing within oneself what is not solely oneself The point is ultimately that intersubjective sensibility inaugurated by the approach of the other person eludes the mechanistic causality observed in natural processes as well as the natural necessity attributed to instincts We shall see shortly what this implies for the famous Third party In order to develop further the idea of signification as pre natural as pre conative Levinas found himself compelled to develop further concepts In he had referred to our desire for the other as religion the bond established between the same and the other and as transascendence Transcendence like desire and inadequation is necessarily a transascendence respectively TI which underscores the immediacy and even sensuousness of the response By Levinas calls the value and dignity of responding to another person illeity He defines illeity as a neologism formed with il he or ille whereby alterity indicates a way of concerning me without entering into conjunction with me without conjunction with me whether in thought or in act OBBE also Beyond the concept of the third party introduced already in Totality and Infinity illeity also refers to something absolute even divine in the other person We can see here how our responsibility to the other thus stands in the place of our responsibility to God or simply evokes it which is a crucial hermeneutic dimension of Judaism The question remains as it did already in Totality and Infinity how does an investiture of this affective intensity pass into rationality Consequently how does embodied affectivity play a transcendental role as condition of possibility in the experience of temporal interruption also known as responsibility i e the moment of my responding Would responsibility and transcendence not thereupon enter the ongoing flow of time transcendental consciousness and be confounded with being as totality The relationship between the transcendental and the empirical has caused much ink to flow For example some have argued that Kant s late published Doctrine of Virtue set forth avenues for empirical illustrations of the transcendental categorial imperative see for example Smit Timmons Indeed ongoing debates have not decided the question of whether the Husserlian temporal transcendental called inner time consciousness is or is not open in its purity to description To be sure the transcendental flow is a condition of possibility of empirical experience in Husserl As to Levinas in both the work and that of we find that the third party denoting both other people and the reprise of intentionality similarly looks at me through the eyes of the other TI Here the passage to reason social existence and objective time occurs because the temporal lapse Levinas calls diachrony is invariably resorbed if in part by intentional consciousness Intersubjective affectivity and in a sense the body itself thus play the role of a transcendental in Levinas who also recognizes that affects are always on the verge of becoming intentional PCIT Appendix in short objects of empirical consciousness In like manner responsibility and fraternity which are formulated by as the other in the same still leave a trace in social relations The trace is mnemonic and bodily as indicated and it emerges from affective relationality its condition of possibility We find it in our concern for restorative justice even for a more modest equity This empirical concern for justice does not erase the Hobbesian conception of drives in human collectivities The trace introduces ambiguity into existence or being it allows exceptional acts of generosity to phenomenalize In temporal terms diachrony crosses through synchrony Or as Herzog puts it the world although chaotic is also the site in which responsibility proves visible Herzog By then the ambiguity of the passive temporality that Levinas likens to ageing and describes as diachrony OBBE relative to the all structuring flow of time consciousness has become more marked Levinas inquires d oes a face abide in representation and in proximity is it community and difference OBBE emph added The answer appears to be yes albeit at two metaphoric levels The face conceived as representation fixes the dynamism of the face as expression representation fixes the dynamism of affective investiture that arises from the aforementioned intersubjective transcendental Adopting a different terminology Levinas writes t he third party introduces a contradiction into the Saying whose signification before the other until then went in one direction toward the singular other The third is of itself the limit of responsibility and the birth of the question What do I have to do with justice A question of consciousness OBBE When we return to a philosophy of consciousness and representation the indispensable figure of the trace that Levinas has introduced becomes attenuated if not suspect As we have seen in order to confront eventual skepticism about the trace he enacts his witness in a literary here and now His figural performance points not toward another world or to a being different from that discussed by Heidegger so much as to the intensities and vulnerability of pre conscious affectivity By textually enacting the immediacy of suffering Levinas appears to offer a poetics of the inexpressible Anckaert Nevertheless since he also demands that we reflect on intersubjectivity from a standpoint outside the face to face encounter his work gives us a double task the as if of his enacted here and now and the development of conceptualization Justice similarly opens to the question what have I to do with justice and even to the representation of justice To be sure this two sided justice entails an additional explanatory move that Levinas cannot make This move would have to account for why third parties insist that I also receive just treatment That is a question requiring the systems perspective outside the now moment in which I emerge and enact my witness affectively invested by alterity OBBE I t is only thanks to God that as a subject in incomparable with the other I am approached as an other by the others that is for myself OBBE trans modified for fluency with the French The equalizing situation from which comparison justice and normativity can be deduced is thus beyond Levinas immediate concern Herzog Such a situation is that of objective or third person consciousness This is for example the approach adopted by Hegel in the Phenomenology of Spirit which he calls the for us as readers or the externalist standpoint Hegel PG Levinas simply marks this standpoint with his expression thanks to God where it is already obvious that God is not a being Although commentators differ on the interpretation of the phrase thanks to God it is repeated in the liturgy Baruch haShem or Baruch atah Adonai blessed be the Name or blessed be Adonai Like other terms and expressions Levinas translates the externalist standpoint into the language of prayer and liturgy In his subsequent use of the expression Levinas sets these words between quotation marks Franck interprets the figure of illeity as bespeaking the force and value of proximity It is the sheer distance of a God that is never a being but in whose trace the Thou or the face that intends and assigns me signifies Franck my trans Marc Faessler ties the word God together with the Saying because it is the trace of an excess that Levinas also calls glory kavod This maintains human practice as an open system the anarchy of God thus opens to a saying God otherwise Autrement dire Dieu Faessler When conceived spatially illeity points to an indeterminate place or source the other always already motivating my saying Taking a further step Levinas extends illeity to the possibility of my receiving justice from other people He writes thanks to God Il I am approached as an other by the others OBBE But again even if universal justice is thanks to God this God is not part of being OBBE a claim familiar to both negative theology and to Maimonides approach to God through human action Levinas is aware of the paradox of human justice being a gift from that which cannot be part of being in which that justice nevertheless occurs He knows the theological reversion to praxis toward which Maimonides gestures at the end of his Guide of the Perplexed The only positive knowledge of God of which man is capable is knowledge of the attributes of action Fagenblat and this is not ultimately knowledge As Levinas puts it to know God is to know what must be done DF It is thus not to know some being or even to erect a regulative idea Froese The dignity and force of illeity share an important connection with what we might call our enacting God through responsibility to the other and through justice Another word for this is holiness whether this comes from me in the form of the Saying or from the others as justice toward me Here lies the point at which a reading begins that bridges the philosophical and the religious dimensions of Levinas thought Indeed as he put it in his article Infinity AT An entire strain of contemporary philosophy setting out from the irreducibility of the interpersonal to relations of objectivity thematization and knowledge is situated in the religious tradition of the idea of the infinite even when it expresses itself in a deliberately and rigorously atheistic way AT emph added This suggests that whether we approach it atheistically or religiously the tension between interpersonal relations and objectivity implies the third party and by extension a social relationality that is indissociable from justice and politics But it is not clear that Levinas ever decided whether politics implied above all war or the means toward a peaceable State In his late essay Peace and Proximity Levinas expressed an attitude surprisingly favorable to the idea of the politics which when the State is a liberal one evinces palpable aspects of the trace of responsibility in its policies It is not without importance to know and this is perhaps the European experience of the twentieth century whether the egalitarian and just State and its politics in which the European is fulfilled proceeds from a war of all against all or from the irreducible responsibility of the one for the other in Rolland ed my trans Jared Highlen develops a coherent argument on the basis of the distinction introduced in the same article between the peace of the State and a peace founded on separation the separation participation of the subject in its world but not reducible to it Highlen like Herzog argues that because the third looks at me through the eyes of the other politics is involved from the very beginning Highlen With this claim the face to face entails a measure of violence by excluding other others for whom I may be responsible But this violence is transitional just as the violence of politics which shows itself when politics is left to itself Highlen concludes that on its own terms the political appears not as the necessary dilution of the ethical obligation but rather as its fulfillment See Supplement S on Politics and the State for further discussion Herzog has recently strengthened this argument urging that Levinas Talmudic readings provide the indispensable connection to what would be his politics She points out that politics provide his proto ethics with its visibility and with historic sites Consequently politics may be criticized in the name of responsibility or ethics but politics also moderates the radicality of ethical responsibility Although Talmudic politics concerns Jewish communities it often focuses on relations with other nations as well as economic issues from property disputes to equitable salaries As Levinas himself observes the Rabbis cannot forget the organizing principle of Rome and its law pluralism under Empire They therefore anticipate with remarkable independence of spirit modern political philosophy including the philosophy of colonized states against imperial ones Whatever its order the City already insures the rights of human beings against their fellow men BTV Key here are the words whatever its order In the concept of order is already included a minimal protection of rights of human persons with regard to their fellows This is a universal principle with specific instantiations in function of the State We find such pluralism in the Talmud which also carries the secular intuition that it is the human tribunal that should replace divine justice which is not forthcoming Herzog That does not mean that Talmudic justice is not itself a collection of varied responses to what is a just action or law Herzog nevertheless adds the insight that in the Talmud politics is not defined by its modern philosophical attributes it is neither a monopoly of power nor the guardian of individuals natural rights nor a natural expression of the people Politics is defined above all as concern and care for the peoples hunger Herzog This neither denies the plurality of voices nor the potential universality of the singular in the Talmud It emphasizes the original peace or intersubjective responsibility that gives rise to good politics To be sure Levinas is aware that any organized political order can become unjust and even violent for its subjects Anckaert This includes liberal orders based on contractualism Again Levinas is ultimately neither a liberal nor a conservative insofar as Talmudic debate provides him material for a situated politics the latter proves both pluralistic and context dependent See Supplement S on Justice and the State for further discussion The dual preoccupation with justice understood as righteousness and justice understood as civic virtue suggests that together Athens and Jerusalem give us a comprehensive approach to politics as both practice and ideal Drabinski and Fred Moten have questioned this claim to universality Drabinski and with it the category of being Jewish in favor of an emphasis on the passivity intrinsic to a multiplicity of human situations including race ethnicity and gender Yet again it is fair to argue that Levinas is primarily concerned with embodied passivity which he approaches as a transcendental condition of possibility as we have seen Moten takes a different Sartrean tack emphasizing that passivity has multiple meanings It is notably observed in our relations to things rather than to persons thereby spontaneously diminishing their humanity He adds that the Bible and the Greeks when presented as the whole world carry thought toward a teleological reflection that expresses an unacknowledged European malaise wherein the non European precisely receives the status of object Mendel Kranz has recently traced Levinas relationship to this malaise as also to the evolving Zionist project He observes W hat these documents studies suggest is that Levinas was simultaneously waging an ideological battle against the territorial and national codes of the Zionist project and attempting to articulate something of an alternative Kranz In a different vein Ephraim Meir proposes a trans different conversation between Gandhi and Levinas acknowledging that the latter would not unequivocally embrace ahimse non violence including in post colonial situations Meir cites Judith Butler s Levinas inspired claim that all lives should be seen as grievable Butler which entails in its specific way a serious concern with human interdependence Meir See Supplement S on Essays after Otherwise than Being A unique feature of Levinas thought consists in his nuanced return to a humanism of the other person Extending his conception of humanism past what Levinas defined as its four part nature respect for the person a blossoming of human nature of intelligence in science creativity in Art and pleasure in daily life DF toward a Jewish humanism Claire Katz raises the question of education In her book Levinas and the Crisis of Humanism Katz discusses the multiple senses of this other humanism in light of the decline of classical Christian humanism and given the challenges posed to it by both structuralism and poststructuralism Following Levinas Antihumanism and Education Levinas DF Katz traces a dual genealogy that of the loss of legitimacy of Western humanism as philosophy and ethos and that in a sense more significant of the demise of social effectiveness and its intellectual meaning Katz Robin Podolsky has extended the question of an education in responsibility to the creation in of Sumud steadfastness Camp This site in the Hebron hills was conceived as a locus regrouping diaspora Jews Israeli Jews and Palestinians in a community designed as a kind of Levinasian space Podolsky As Podolsky emphasizes such projects are experiments in building a political program from the grass roots up based on investments in one another s well being that cross national and religious divides Their praxis begins with the face to face The term enactivism denotes developments in phenomenology and those cognitive sciences that together date largely from the work of Francesco Varela and Evan Thompson in the s Indebted to the evolving reception of the work of the French philosopher Merleau Ponty enactivism conjoins phenomenology as first person experience with third person descriptions from the cognitive sciences It accepts Heidegger and Merleau Ponty s conceptions of bodies being already in a world their world It takes seriously the existential quality of embodiment and has recently been interested in embodied intersubjectivity Thompson Whereas many from the school of enactivism have approached the work of Levinas with skepticism Koubov Di Paolo et al deeming it dualistic and doubting that encounters with others might escape cognition and unfold at a purely affective level enactivists have nevertheless not engaged Levinas extensively One of the exceptions to this is Sarah Pawlett Jackson who argues that singular experiences of the approach of the other as can be found in both Sartre and Levinas are insufficient to clarifying intersubjectivity among three or more people Pawlett Jackson At the same time Fabrice M tais and Mario Villalobos have countered that Levinas work can be instrumental in developing a bona fide enactivist embodied ethics M tais Villalobos Close to the work of cognitivist Tom Froese M tais and Villalobos argue that enactivism has fallen into the trap of a third person intersubjectivity The latter consists in focusing on intersubjectivity as a social aggregate a site of shared existence invariably tied up with ontology or groups describable in neutral rather than ethical language The authors define this as an approach to distinctional otherness the way natural language speaks in the third person of the one and the other as though they were objects A different modality of otherness focuses on the second person thou you and thus on the differences between agents or subjects All these conceptions of otherness have value and find their use in enactivist cognitive science Levinas philosophy offers a way to expand this approach His conception of otherness is ethical practical and therefore neither an ontological category nor an epistemic limitation in the realm of beings M tais Villalobos This distinction undergirds what enactivists call participatory sense making which include phenomena flowing from the face to face relation and networks of enactive agents Their argument thus addresses Pawlett Jackson s objection concerning interconnected selves and others Considered together Pawlett Jackson M tais and Villalobos arguably represent a new direction for enactivism which has already shown important potential for self correction and expansion They argue that second person perspectives on sociality are often presupposed even before the question of otherness arises including in terms of ethics This maintains alterity at one remove from the encounters that Levinas describes and which come to light in the approach and call of another person The upshot of more traditional enactivism is a horizontal conception of sociality often limited to epistemic questions As M tais and Villalobos see it the way they enactivists use the concept of irreducible otherness as the otherness of the other subject does not imply any modification of the process through which sense is produced sense making and thus does not indicate any breach of self contained consciousness beyond the sphere of constitution and ontology As indicated this concept of otherness overlooks the ethical dimension of sense making which arises for Levinas in the immediate encounter with an other who is both embodied and carries their own perspective M tais and Villalobos argue that enactivists have treated the pair knowability and unknowability in light of a more conventional object versus subject otherness Commentators have differed on the comparative importance of Levinas major works Totality and Infinity and Otherwise than Being Some have urged that we see in them two sides of a single coin that of responsibility experienced in the face to face encounter and that of the insistence of an affective trace that interrupts flowing time as conceived by classical phenomenology Peperzak Other commentators have argued that Otherwise than Being is Levinas magnum opus a study on the relational pre conditions of language indebted to yet diverging from Heidegger s investigations of the poetic logos Heidegger As we have seen Derrida called Totality and Infinity a treatise on hospitality see supra and devoted in sum more attention to it than to Otherwise than Being although the latter work was in part a response to Derrida s criticisms in Violence and Metaphysics Derrida It remains that Otherwise than Being reprises elements of Levinas early research into metaphor as the performative basis of language as well as his engagement with Merleau Ponty s cultural significations both of which are responsible for a distinct conception of existence For Levinas beneath cultures and significations there remains a trace of a non relative meaning sens which includes the absoluteness of the presence of the other Levinas b In this regard the publication of Totality and Infinity was followed closely by two essays A talk intitled La m taphore presented at Jean Wahl s Coll ge philosophique dates from February The article Meaning and Sense La signification et le sens first appeared in Levinas As much as the latter article placed Heidegger s fundamental ontology within historically specific cultures and privileged sense over being La m taphore returned to a Maimonidean conception of human language as allegory and expressing more than the words said therein Given these preparations there is little question that the novelty of Otherwise than Being lies in its three innovations the tropes metaphors for transcendence in immanence i e recurrence proximity obsession persecution and substitution the deconstruction of language understood as the site in which existence is stated as an address and Levinas wager of stepping out of philosophical reasoning to envision a trace encountered in a performative register that both says and unsays itself by turns OBBE Despite these innovations Levinas philosophical project remains largely constant to rethink the meaning of existence in terms of the transcendence of the other and its meaning for ethics To that end he consistently revisited Husserl s phenomenological method He reconceived Heidegger s ontological difference as an irreducible separation between being and the good we enact He had extensive often undeclared recourse to the profound anti totalizing intuitions of religious life as found in Rosenzweig s new thinking and indirectly in Maimonides apophaticism By reason of his opposition to systems thought Levinas never adhered uncritically to any one philosophy A common thread runs through his philosophy and his Talmudic readings Transcendence is one of his words for the spontaneity of responsibility for another person Responsibility is experienced in concrete life and is variously expressed from words like here I am to apologies and self accounting This is the case Levinas argues even before a de facto command is heard or reflected upon This surprising proposition hearkens to the debated meaning of Jews receiving the Torah before knowing what was written in it NTR Levinas names this responsiveness Platonically as the Good beyond being We perform that good that trace of the infinite because instances of answering to or for another are everyday events even though they do not appear typical of self interested behaviors Above all we do not choose to be responsible Responsibility arises as if elicited before we begin to think about it by the approach of the other person Because this theme is found in his philosophy as well as in his interpretations of Talmudic passages Levinas thought has at times left both Talmud scholars and philosophers dissatisfied For some Talmudists his thought seems secularly humanistic with infinity suggesting a clandestine concept of divinity No stranger to Mishnah and Gemara Talmud his interpretations are less preoccupied with traditional inter and intra textuality than with the ethical content of the teachings therein To philosophers skeptical of him Levinas thought reinterprets Heidegger s in the world facticity in a metaphysical vein Indeed its anti foundationalist approach to responsibility as the pre reflective structure of the embodied relational self soi appears to these critics to move inconsistently between phenomenology and religious thought despite its lack of dogmatic commitments As we have seen in his later philosophy the seemingly metaphysical concept of illeity expresses my emotive experience of an affective excess greater than that which I can contain In this way it also resembles Descartes light so resplendent Med III But it is precisely in these tensions between the Jewish religious and philosophical traditions on the one hand and his phenomenological existential thinking of the other on the other hand that Levinas

Source Xinhua Editor huaxia BEIJING Nov Xinhua Imagine a football match with more than fans roaring and cheering A World Cup qualifier No A Champions League knockout tie Guess again Maybe a Shanghai derby in the Chinese Super League Sorry wrong yet again The correct answer is that this packed and loud stadium witnessed the final of the Su Super League an amateur soccer competition in east China s Jiangsu Province that has become a nationwide sensation What unfolded in stadiums during the Su Super League notably is offering a window into China s evolving consumer market When people hear consumption many would picture a bustling mall or a person carrying several shopping bags filled to the brim However China s consumer market is redefining this term As the country positions domestic demand as its primary growth engine over the next five years a diverse array of new consumer trends is taking hold reshaping the world s second largest economy Among the major goals listed in the Communist Party of China Central Committee s recommendations for the formulation of the country s development plan for the next five years the country aims to significantly increase the share of consumer spending in the economy and continuously improve domestic demand s role in driving economic growth To achieve this goal the recommendations call for expanding the supply of high quality consumer goods and services and the cultivation of a wide variety of new consumption scenarios China has a solid foundation for realizing this goal Latest data showed that in the first nine months of China s total retail sales of consumer goods rose percent year on year to trillion yuan about trillion U S dollars with the pace of growth percentage point faster than in Also final consumer spending contributed percent of total economic growth during this period China s Ministry of Commerce said Backed by pro consumption policies and technological advances across sectors new consumption models are gathering pace helping channel demand into more scenarios and inject more vitality into the economy QUALITY MATTERS MORE According to the recommendations document issued by the Communist Party of China Central Committee China will step up efforts to ensure that new demand drives new supply that new supply helps create fresh demand Via policy support and market momentum quality improvement is set to be a hallmark of the Chinese consumer market in the coming five years Keqiao the world s largest textile distribution hub has long been renowned for materials used in a wide range of products ranging from curtains to apparel Today this bustling district in east China s Zhejiang Province is making inroads into a burgeoning new field We ve seen rising consumer demand for technical apparel as outdoor sports gain momentum across the country said Yao Ming president of Jiangsu Sunfeng Special Material Technology Co Ltd a producer dedicated to breathable sustainable performance fabrics that recently launched an outlet in Keqiao Currently an increasing number of textile manufacturers are riding the wave in Keqiao which in March this year transformed a square meter market zone to focus on high tech outdoor functional fabrics featuring qualities such as thermal insulation windproofing and water repellency This strategic shift in Keqiao s textile industry reveals a broader national trend in China A survey by Trendforesee Consulting found that rather than focusing solely on cost effectiveness consumers are increasingly seeking an optimal balance of price and quality while prioritizing products and services that maximize happiness comfort and satisfaction Quality and personalization will likely become two major driving forces for China s consumption growth over the coming five years said Zhu Keli founding dean of the China Institute of New Economy Consumer demand is shifting from pure functionality to ease of use with technology products such as smart home devices and health monitoring equipment moving into the mainstream Data from the State Administration for Market Regulation revealed that in the first three quarters of the number of barcode registered smartwatch models in China had reached marking a percent average annual growth rate since the end of September In addition registered smart glasses models totaled up percent annually In response to rising consumer expectations when it comes to quality a transformation is advancing across the entire supply chain For example Chinese retail giant Shein is collaborating with research institutions to drive technological innovation and promote a greener smarter supply chain In partnership with Donghua University in east China Shein has developed a new generation of polyester intermediate recycling solutions which ensure the quality of regenerated polyester products and reduce the cost of recylcing To further boost product quality improvement Yu Fengxia an official at the State Information Center called for stronger support for corporate research and development including establishing a fund dedicated to fostering innovation in technological consumer goods Efforts should also focus on creating a favorable environment for the technological consumer market with measures such as tax cuts and coupons to lower the thresholds for technological product consumption Yu said EMOTIONS DRIVE CONSUMPTION Made up of teams from cities in Jiangsu the Su Super League ignited regional rivalries and sparked grassroots participation emerging as one of the most talked about sporting events in China Official data show that during the regular season average match attendance reached nearly while cumulative online viewership surpassed billion I feel incredibly lucky to experience the passion of football and travel with my family This is what a perfect weekend feels like said Li Hui a football fan from Shanghai who attended the final in Nanjing last weekend According to Li he and his family received customized discounts on attractions and accommodation during their stay simply by presenting their tickets for the final To capitalize on the league s popularity local governments rolled out multiple measures to encourage visitors to stay longer and spend more in host cities In Wuxi for example a football themed night market served barbecue and beer while an average of fans watched each game on outdoor screens According to the provincial commerce department since the Su Super League kicked off in May sales at major retailers shopping malls and supermarkets in Jiangsu has reached billion yuan a percent surge from the same period a year earlier Fueled by this football craze Jiangsu s total retail sales of consumer goods hit trillion yuan in the period from January to September up percent year on year and leading the country in terms of value The league has pioneered a consumption model that blends sporting events cultural tourism and retail and it is spreading nationwide At present more than provincial level amateur football leagues are either underway or slated to begin soon Analysts note that this model while fanning sporting passions is also further unlocking China s consumer potential Commenting on the Su Super League s unprecedented success Ding Xiang a scholar at Nanjing University in Jiangsu said that emotional value and scenario based experiences are reshaping China s consumer market as consumers show a growing appetite for outdoor locally rooted and immersive forms of consumption A broader wave of new consumption scenarios rooted in emotional bonds and cultural identity is unfolding across China In Hangzhou the capital of Zhejiang Province an official Black Myth Wukong theme store has recently opened to the public Showcasing merchandise from the blockbuster game inspired by Chinese mythology and culture including toys handicrafts and beverages the Hangzhou store is quickly becoming a must see spot for visitors to this world famous tourist city In September the ministries of finance and commerce jointly launched a pilot program to promote new forms models and scenarios of consumption To further diversify service consumption the plan calls for extending major sporting events into commercial districts neighborhoods and scenic spots while encouraging deeper use of artificial intelligence the metaverse and other digital technologies across culture and entertainment tourism healthcare and sports Looking ahead Chen Sumei a scholar at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said that key areas of new consumption have positive growth prospects over the next five years Fueled by the accelerated cultivation of new quality productive forces and the promotion of green consumption new consumption models will become a significant growth driver for China s economy Chen explained Chen added that the country should focus on improving product quality to meet diverse and personalized consumer demands while addressing emerging needs across different consumer groups by creating new consumption scenarios and expanding supply

Reforms to boost investment and strengthen fiscal policy could help turn the tide WASHINGTON Jan As the world nears the midpoint of what was intended to be a transformative decade for development the global economy is set to rack up a sorry record by the end of the slowest half decade of GDP growth in years according to the World Bank s latest Global Economic Prospects report By one measure the global economy is in a better place than it was a year ago the risk of a global recession has receded largely because of the strength of the U S economy But mounting geopolitical tensions could create fresh near term hazards for the world economy Meanwhile the medium term outlook has darkened for many developing economies amid slowing growth in most major economies sluggish global trade and the tightest financial conditions in decades Global trade growth in is expected to be only half the average in the decade before the pandemic Meanwhile borrowing costs for developing economies especially those with poor credit ratings are likely to remain steep with global interest rates stuck at four decade highs in inflation adjusted terms Global growth is projected to slow for the third year in a row from last year to in almost three quarters of a percentage point below the average of the s Developing economies are projected to grow just more than one percentage point below the average of the previous decade After a disappointing performance last year low income countries should grow weaker than previously expected By the end of people in about one out of every four developing countries and about of low income countries will still be poorer than they were on the eve of the COVID pandemic in In advanced economies meanwhile growth is set to slow to this year from in Without a major course correction the s will go down as a decade of wasted opportunity said Indermit Gill the World Bank Group s Chief Economist and Senior Vice President Near term growth will remain weak leaving many developing countries especially the poorest stuck in a trap with paralyzing levels of debt and tenuous access to food for nearly one out of every three people That would obstruct progress on many global priorities Opportunities still exist to turn the tide This report offers a clear way forward it spells out the transformation that can be achieved if governments act now to accelerate investment and strengthen fiscal policy frameworks To tackle climate change and achieve other key global development goals by developing countries will need to deliver a formidable increase in investment about trillion per year Without a comprehensive policy package prospects for such an increase are not bright Per capita investment growth in developing economies between and is expected to average only just over half the rate of the previous two decades The report offers the first global analysis of what it will take to generate a sustained investment boom drawing from the experience of advanced economies and developing economies over the past years It finds that developing economies often reap an economic windfall when they accelerate per capita investment growth to at least and sustain it for six years or more the pace of convergence with advanced economy income levels speeds up the poverty rate declines more swiftly and productivity growth quadruples Other benefits also materialize during these booms among other things inflation falls fiscal and external positions improve and people s access to the internet expands rapidly Investment booms have the potential to transform developing economies and help them speed up the energy transition and achieve a wide variety of development objectives said Ayhan Kose the World Bank s Deputy Chief Economist and Director of the Prospects Group To spark such booms developing economies need to implement comprehensive policy packages to improve fiscal and monetary frameworks expand cross border trade and financial flows improve the investment climate and strengthen the quality of institutions That is hard work but many developing economies have been able to do it before Doing it again will help mitigate the projected slowdown in potential growth in the rest of this decade The latest Global Economic Prospects also identifies what two thirds of developing countries commodity exporters specifically can do to avoid boom and bust cycles The report finds that governments in these countries often adopt fiscal policies that intensify booms and busts When increases in commodity prices boost growth by percentage point for example governments increase spending in ways that boost growth by an additional percentage point In general in good times fiscal policy tends to overheat the economy In bad times it deepens the slump This procyclicality is percent stronger in commodity exporting developing economies than it is in other developing economies Fiscal policies also tend to be percent more volatile in these economies than in other developing economies The instability associated with higher procyclicality and volatility of fiscal policy produces a chronic drag on the growth prospects of commodity exporting developing economies The drag can be reduced by putting in place a fiscal framework that helps discipline government spending by adopting flexible exchange rate regimes and by avoiding restrictions on the movement of international capital On average these policy measures could help commodity exporters in developing economies boost their per capita GDP growth by as much as percentage point every four or five years Countries can also benefit by building sovereign wealth funds and other rainy day funds that can be deployed quickly in an emergency Download the full report https www

The global economy is facing substantial headwinds emanating largely from an increase in trade tensions and heightened global policy uncertainty For emerging market and developing economies EMDEs the weak outlook limits their ability to boost job creation and reduce extreme poverty This challenging context is compounded by subdued foreign direct investment into EMDEs Global cooperation is needed to restore a more stable global trade environment and scale up support for vulnerable countries including those in fragile and conflict situations Domestic policy action is also critical to contain inflation risks and strengthen fiscal resilience To unlock job creation and long term growth reforms should focus on raising institutional quality attracting private investment and strengthening human capital and labor markets International discord particularly over trade has upended many of the policy certainties that helped shrink extreme poverty and expand prosperity after the end of World War II says World Bank Group Chief Economist and Senior Vice President Indermit Gill in his Foreword Global growth this year is expected to be the weakest in years outside of outright recessions By global GDP growth is expected to average just percent in the s the slowest pace of any decade since the s The time has come for a reset he says one that involves renewed global cooperation restored fiscal responsibility and a relentless focus on creating jobs Global growth is slowing following a sharp rise in trade barriers and heightened policy uncertainty Growth is expected to weaken to percent in a significant downgrade from previous forecasts with only a tepid recovery expected in Growth could be lower if trade restrictions escalate or if policy uncertainty persists Other downside risks include weaker than expected growth in major economies worsening conflicts and extreme weather events Multilateral policy efforts are needed to foster a more predictable and transparent environment for resolving trade tensions Policy makers need to keep inflation contained and strengthen fiscal positions while also undertaking reforms that enhance institutional quality stimulate private investment and improve human capital and labor market functioning All emerging market and developing economy EMDE regions face a challenging outlook amid the rising trade tensions and heightened global uncertainty with growth forecasts for downgraded in all EMDE regions relative to January projections Growth is projected to slow in East Asia and Pacific as well as in Europe and Central Asia both regions that are highly reliant on global trade and to a lesser extent in South Asia In Latin America and the Caribbean growth is projected to be the lowest among EMDE regions over the forecast horizon as activity is held back by high trade barriers and longstanding structural weaknesses In regions with a large number of commodity exporters including the Middle East and North Africa and Sub Saharan Africa growth is anticipated to be weighed down by the weakening outlook for external commodity demand In low income countries LICs growth is projected to rise to percent in and average percent in However this outlook hinges on a de escalation of conflict in some countries and a moderation in inflation The weaker global environment has led to a significant downward revision to LICs growth this year Although per capita income is projected to grow by percent annually this is insufficient to recover pandemic related losses or reduce extreme poverty which has been exacerbated by violent conflict Trade tensions have been particularly harmful to commodity exporters Reduced fiscal space from debt costs and declining donor support continues to hamper development Downside risks include escalating conflicts food insecurity weaker demand persistent inflation and extreme weather Growth in the East Asia and Pacific region is projected to slow to percent in and to percent in both and reflecting rising trade barriers and heightened policy uncertainty In China growth is expected to decline to percent in with fiscal support assumed to offset the impact of trade tensions Elsewhere in the region growth is projected to slow to percent this year due to higher trade barriers and a weaker external environment Downside risks to the outlook dominate with persistently elevated policy uncertainty escalating trade tensions and more frequent natural disasters Upside risks from a partial resolution of trade tensions or technology adoption could also materialize Growth in Europe and Central Asia is projected to slow to percent in before edging up to percent in remaining below its average and limiting progress in job creation and income convergence A challenging external environment marked by rising trade barriers and heightened policy uncertainty is expected to weigh on regional activity The slowdown mainly reflects a step down in the Russian Federation Downside risks include a prolonged extension or intensification of Russia s invasion of Ukraine further escalation of global trade tensions and policy uncertainty weaker euro area growth and persistent inflation Upside risks include an earlier than expected end to active hostilities associated with the invasion or faster adoption of artificial intelligence Growth in Latin America and the Caribbean LAC is forecast to remain steady at percent in and then firm to an average of percent in Although Mexico will be most directly affected by the rise in recent trade barriers given its tight integration with the U S economy the entire region will be indirectly impacted by policy uncertainty through trade investment and financial links Risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside weaker than expected global growth could further dampen activity while tightening global financial conditions may raise debt servicing costs A sharper than expected slowdown in U S growth could impact exports and remittances further constraining per capita income gains Growth in the Middle East and North Africa region is projected to strengthen to percent in and average percent in mainly due to an expansion of oil activity in oil exporters Growth in oil importers is also expected to rise reflecting an assumed stabilization of armed conflicts in the region and waning inflationary pressures However growth forecasts have been downgraded from January projections amid a rise in trade barriers Downside risks to the outlook include the possibility that global trade tensions will escalate further policy uncertainty will remain elevated or global financial conditions will deteriorate Lower than expected oil prices and a re escalation of armed conflicts could also dampen growth Although growth in South Asia is projected to remain the fastest among emerging market and developing economy regions regional prospects are dimming amid rising global trade barriers and elevated uncertainty Growth is expected to moderate to percent in and then average percent in remaining below the pre pandemic average Risks to the growth outlook are tilted to the downside with the possibility of intensified trade barriers and heightened global policy uncertainty as the most pressing risks Other downside risks include tighter global financial conditions instability in the financial sector surges in violence and social unrest further declines in official aid and extreme weather events Growth in Sub Saharan Africa SSA is forecast to edge up from percent in to percent in and then average percent in Growth this year and next is expected to be weaker than previously anticipated reflecting a deteriorating external environment and persistent domestic headwinds High government debt and interest rates have constrained fiscal space forcing consolidation amid reduced aid Per capita income growth remains insufficient to significantly reduce extreme poverty The region also faces an acute jobs challenge as employment creation continues to lag behind the rapid expansion of the working age population Downside risks include weaker external demand from trade tensions China s slowdown political instability rising sovereign spreads and climate related threats such as droughts and extreme weather events Foreign direct investment FDI inflows are a vital source of funding to catalyze economic growth facilitate domestic private capital mobilization and create jobs especially for low income countries with scarce domestic capital resources and vast infrastructure gaps However FDI inflows to emerging market and developing economies EMDEs have steadily fallen in the past decade Elevated trade tensions policy uncertainty and heightened macroeconomic and geopolitical risks continue to exert downward pressures on FDI Policymakers in EMDEs need to accelerate domestic reforms that will help attract FDI and amplify its benefits All countries need to work to advance global cooperation to reinstall a

Source Xinhua Editor huaxia BEIJING Nov Xinhua A new campaign to expand imports Big Market for All Export to China was launched in Shanghai this Tuesday underscoring China s commitment to wider opening up and sharing its vast market with the rest of the world Elaborating on the campaign s significance Commerce Minister Wang Wentao described market access as the most scarce resource in today s world He announced that the campaign would feature over events each year with the goal of establishing China as the best export destination The move dovetails with the recently released recommendations for formulating the th Five Year Plan which advocates for balanced development of imports and exports a strategy set to fuel China s high quality development and give a boost to the global economy MORE BALANCED TRADE While China s economic model has long faced criticism for its reliance on export led growth a closer look reveals that a significant transformation is already unfolding Official data shows that China has ranked as the world s second largest import market for consecutive years with goods and services imports projected to exceed trillion U S dollars during the th Five Year Plan period Import growth accelerated in the first three quarters of this year with agricultural imports reaching billion U S dollars up percent year on year while imports of mechanical and electrical products and high tech products rose percent and percent respectively In recent years China has built a comprehensive network of national regional and online platforms to expand imports The China International Import Expo CIIE is a case in point As the world s first national level import expo the CIIE has achieved cumulative intended transactions exceeding billion U S dollars over seven sessions The ongoing eighth edition features the largest exhibition area and a record number of exhibitors to date Over the next five years as external demand ceases to be the sole pillar of its growth China will synergize wider opening up with a bolstered domestic market to pursue more balanced growth in both exports and imports according to a report by KPMG China DOMESTIC SIGNIFICANCE China s push to expand imports has two major domestic goals upgrading its industries and meeting the demands of its increasingly affluent shoppers On the industrial front imports function as important inputs for technological advancement By expanding imports of high end goods advanced machinery and critical components Chinese industries can accelerate their ascent up the value chain said Bai Ming a researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation Some observers also point to the catfish effect of expanded imports as a catalyst for China s industrial upgrading The influx of foreign products raises competitive pressure in the domestic market To survive and thrive in this more challenging environment homegrown companies are motivated to increase R D spending and enhance the quality and technological sophistication of their products The process will help them secure their own market position and propel innovation and upgrading across the entire industrial chain Simultaneously imports satisfy the burgeoning demands of China s expanding middle class projected to surpass million people within the next decade With Chinese residents aspiring to a better life services imports such as tourism and medical care are expected to continue rising said Zhao Fujun a researcher with the Development Research Center of the State Council WORLD S MARKET As China opens its vast market it is creating substantial opportunities for economies worldwide For developed countries it represents access to a super large market for high value goods and services For instance in U S essential oil firm doTERRA took part in the inaugural CIIE and landed an unexpected million yuan about million U S dollars in orders Today China has become doTERRA s second largest market globally Our goal is to make China our number one market by said Owen Messick president of doTERRA China For developing economies particularly those in Africa China s import demand offers a pathway to sustainable growth The implementation of zero tariff treatment for percent of tariff lines for African nations has already yielded a percent growth in imports from these countries during the first three quarters of This approach allows developing nations to capitalize on their comparative advantages build manufacturing capabilities and integrate into global value chains China s import growth is not just about buying more It is about building more inclusive and multipolar trade networks Bai said Looking forward China is expected to further facilitate customs clearance reduce institutional costs and forge more free trade agreements Over the next five years China s balanced approach of imports and exports promises to create a more sustainable growth model for China and a more collaborative future for global trade according to analysts
In the quantum realm there are curious correlations between the properties of distant systems An example of such correlations is provided by the famous Einstein Podolsky Rosen Bohm experiment The correlations in the EPR B experiment strongly suggest that there are non local influences between distant systems i e systems between which no light signal can travel and indeed orthodox quantum mechanics and its various interpretations postulate the existence of such non locality Yet the question of whether the EPR B correlations imply non locality and the exact nature of this non locality is a matter of ongoing controversy Focusing on EPR B type experiments in this entry we consider the nature of the various kinds of non locality postulated by different interpretations of quantum mechanics Based on this consideration we briefly discuss the compatibility of these interpretations with the special theory of relativity The quantum realm involves curious correlations between distant events A well known example is David Bohm s version of the famous thought experiment that Einstein Podolsky and Rosen proposed in henceforth the EPR B experiment Pairs of particles are emitted from a source in the so called spin singlet state and rush in opposite directions see Fig below When the particles are widely separated from each other they each encounter a measuring apparatus that can be set to measure their spin components along various directions Although the measurement events are distant from each other so that no slower than light or light signal can travel between them the measurement outcomes are curiously correlated That is while the outcome of each of the distant spin measurements seems to be a matter of pure chance they are correlated with each other The joint probability of the distant outcomes is different from the product of their single probabilities For example the probability that each of the particles will spin clockwise about the z axis in a z spin measurement i e a measurement of the spin component along the z direction appears to be Yet the outcomes of such measurements are perfectly anti correlated If the left hand side L particle happens to spin clockwise anti clockwise about the z axis the right hand side R particle will spin anti clockwise clockwise about that axis And this is true even if the measurements are made simultaneously Figure A schematic illustration of the EPR B experiment Particle pairs in the spin singlet state are emitted in opposite directions and when they are distant from each other i e space like separated they encounter measurement apparatuses that can be set to measure spin components along various directions The curious EPR B correlations strongly suggest the existence of non local influences between the two measurement events and indeed orthodox collapse quantum mechanics supports this suggestion According to this theory before the measurements the particles do not have any definite spin The particles come to possess a definite spin only with the first spin measurement and the outcome of this measurement is a matter of chance If for example the first measurement is a z spin measurement on the L particle the L particle will spin either clockwise or anti clockwise about the z axis with equal chance And the outcome of the L measurement causes an instantaneous change in the spin properties of the distant R particle If the L particle spins clockwise anti clockwise about the z axis the R particle will instantly spin anti clockwise clockwise about the same axis It is common to call spins in opposite directions spin up and spin down where by convention a clockwise spinning may be called spin up and anti clockwise spinning may be called spin down It may be argued that orthodox quantum mechanics is false and that the non locality postulated by it does not reflect any non locality in the quantum realm Alternatively it may be argued that orthodox quantum mechanics is a good instrument for predictions rather than a fundamental theory of the physical nature of the universe On this instrumental interpretation the predictions of quantum mechanics are not an adequate basis for any conclusion about non locality This theory is just an incredible oracle or a crystal ball which provides a very successful algorithm for predicting measurement outcomes and their probabilities but it offers little information about ontological matters such as the nature of objects properties and causation in the quantum realm Einstein Podolsky and Rosen thought that quantum mechanics is incomplete and that the curious correlations between distant systems do not amount to action at a distance between them The apparent instantaneous change in the R particle s properties during the L measurement is not really a change of properties but rather a change of knowledge For more about the EPR argument see the entry on the EPR argument Redhead chapter and Albert chapter For discussions of the EPR argument in the relativistic context see Ghirardi and Grassi and Redhead and La Riviere On this view quantum states of systems do not always reflect their complete state Quantum states of systems generally provide information about some of the properties that systems possess and information about the probabilities of outcomes of measurements on them and this information does not generally reflect the complete state of the systems In particular the information encoded in the spin singlet state is about the probabilities of measurement outcomes of spin properties in various directions about the conditional probabilities that the L R particle has a certain spin property given that the R L particle has another spin property and about the anti correlation between the spins that the particles may have in any given direction for more details see section Thus the outcome of a z spin measurement on the L particle and the spin singlet state interpreted as a state of knowledge jointly provide information about the z spin property of the R particle For example if the outcome of the L measurement is z spin up we know that the R particle has z spin down and if we assume as EPR did that there is no curious action at a distance between the distant wings and that the change of the quantum mechanical state of the particle pair in the L measurement is only a change in state of knowledge we could also conclude that the R particle had z spin down even before the L measurement occurs How could the L outcome change our knowledge ignorance about the R outcome if it has no influence on it The simplest and most straightforward reply is that the L and the R outcome have a common cause that causes them to be correlated so that knowledge of one outcome provides knowledge about the other Yet the question is whether the predictions of orthodox quantum mechanics which have been highly confirmed by various experiments are compatible with the quantum realm being local in the sense of involving no influences between systems between which light and slower than light signals cannot travel i e space like separated systems More particularly the question is whether it is possible to construct a local common cause model of the EPR B experiment i e a model that postulates no influence between systems events in the distant wings of the experiment and that the correlation between them are due to the state of the particle pair at the source In Einstein Podolsky and Rosen believed that this is possible But as John Bell demonstrated in this belief is difficult to uphold In a famous theorem John Bell demonstrated that granted some plausible assumptions any local model of the EPR B experiment is committed to certain inequalities about the probabilities of measurement outcomes the Bell inequalities which are incompatible with the quantum mechanical predictions When Bell proved his theorem the EPR B experiment was only a thought experiment But due to technological advances various versions of this experiment have been conducted since the s and their results have overwhelmingly supported the quantum mechanical predictions for brief reviews of these experiments and further references see the entry on Bell s theorem and Redhead chapter section and Notes and References Thus a wide consensus has it that the quantum realm involves some type of non locality The basic idea of Bell s theorem is as follows A model of the EPR B experiment postulates that the state of the particle pair together with the apparatus settings to measure or not to measure certain spin properties determine the probabilities for single and joint spin measurement outcomes A local Bell model of this experiment also postulates that probabilities of joint outcomes factorize into the single probabilities of the L and the R outcomes The probability of joint outcomes is equal to the product of the probabilities of the single outcomes More formally let denote the pair s state before any measurement occurs Let l denote the setting of the L measurement apparatus to measure spin along the l axis i e the l spin of the L particle and let r denote the setting of the R measurement apparatus to measure spin along the r axis i e the r spin of the R particle Let xl be the outcome of a l spin measurement in the L wing and let yr be the outcome of a r spin measurement in the R wing where xl is either the L outcome l spin up or the L outcome l spin down and yr is either the R outcome r spin up or the R outcome r spin down Let P l r xl yr be the joint probability of the L and the R outcome and P l xl and P r yr be the single probabilities of the L and the R outcome respectively where the subscripts l and r denote the factors that are relevant for the probabilities of the outcomes xl and yr Then for any l r xl and yr Here and henceforth for simplicity s sake we shall denote events and states such as the measurement outcomes and the propositions that they occur by the same symbols The state is typically thought of as the pair s state at the emission time and it is assumed that this state does not change in any relevant sense between the emission and the first measurement It is generally a different state from the quantum mechanical pair s state is assumed to be an incomplete state of the pair whereas is supposed to be a more complete state of the pair Accordingly pairs with the same state may have different states which give rise to different probabilities of outcomes for the same type of measurements Also the states may be unknown hidden inaccessible or uncontrollable Factorizability is commonly motivated as a locality condition In non local models of the EPR B experiment the correlations between the distant outcomes are accounted for by non local influences between the distant measurement events For example in orthodox quantum mechanics the first spin measurement on say the L particle causes an immediate change in the spin properties of the R particle and in the probabilities of future outcomes of spin measurements on this particle By contrast in local models of this experiment the correlations are supposed to be accounted for by a common cause the pair s state see Fig below The pair s state and the L setting determine the probability of the L outcome the pair s state and the R setting determine the probability of the R outcome and the pair s state and the L and the R setting determine the probability of joint outcomes which as mentioned above is simply the product of these single probabilities The idea is that the probability of each of the outcomes is determined by local events i e events that are confined to its backward light cone and which can only exert subluminal or luminal influences on it see Figure below and the distant outcomes are fundamentally independent of each other and thus their joint probability factorizes For more about this reasoning see sections and Figure A schematic common cause model of the EPR B experiment Arrows denote causal connections Figure A space time diagram of a local model of the EPR B experiment The circles represent the measurement events and the cones represent their backward light cones i e the boundaries of all the subluminal and luminal influences on them The dotted lines denote the propagation of the influences of the pair s state at the emission and of the settings of the measurement apparatuses on the measurement outcomes A Bell model of the EPR B experiment also postulates that for each quantum mechanical state there is a distribution over all the possible pair states which is independent of the settings of the apparatuses That is the distribution of the complete states depends on the incomplete state and this distribution is independent of the particular choice of measurements in the L and R wing including the choice not to measure any quantity Or formally for any quantum mechanical state L settings l and l and R settings r and r where the subscripts denote the factors that are potentially relevant for the distribution of the states Although the model probabilities i e the probabilities of outcomes prescribed by the states are different from the corresponding quantum mechanical probabilities of outcomes i e the probabilities prescribed by the quantum mechanical states the quantum mechanical probabilities which have been systematically confirmed are recovered by averaging over the model probabilities That is it is supposed that the quantum mechanical probabilities P l r xl yr P l xl and P r yr are obtained by averaging over the model probabilities P l r xl yr P l xl and P r yr respectively For any l r xl and yr The assumption of independence is very plausible It postulates that complete pair states at the source are uncorrelated with the settings of the measurement apparatuses And independently of one s philosophical view about free will this assumption is strongly suggested by our experience according to which it seems possible to prepare the state of particle pairs at the source independently of the set up of the measurement apparatuses There are two ways to try to explain a failure of independence One possible explanation is that pairs states and apparatus settings share a common cause which always correlates certain types of pairs states with certain types of L and R setting Such a causal hypothesis will be difficult to reconcile with the common belief that apparatus settings are controllable at experimenters will and thus could be set independently of the pair s state at the source Furthermore thinking of all the different ways one can measure spin properties and the variety of ways in which apparatus settings can be chosen the postulation of such common cause explanation for settings and pairs states would seem highly ad hoc and its existence conspiratorial Another possible explanation for the failure of independence is that the apparatus settings influence the pair s state at the source and accordingly the distribution of the possible pairs states is dependent upon the settings Since the settings can be made after the emission of the particle pair from the source this kind of violation of independence would require backward causation For advocates of this way out of non locality see Costa de Beauregard Sutherland and Price chapters and On some readings of John Cramer s transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics see Maudlin pp such violation of independence is postulated According to this interpretation the source sends offer waves forward to the measurement apparatuses and the apparatuses send confirmation waves from the space time regions of the measurement events backward to the source thus affecting the states of emitted pairs according to the settings of the apparatuses The question of whether such a theory can reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics is a controversial matter see Maudlin pp Berkovitz section and Kastner It is noteworthy however that while the violation of independence is sufficient for circumventing Bell s theorem the failure of this condition per se does not substantiate locality The challenge of providing a local model of the EPR B experiment also applies to models that violate independence For more about these issues see sections and In any case as Bell s theorem demonstrates factorizability independence and empirical adequacy jointly imply the Bell inequalities which are violated by the predictions of orthodox quantum mechanics Bell a b Granted the systematic confirmation of the predictions of orthodox quantum mechanics and the plausibility of independence Bell inferred that factorizability fails in the EPR B experiment Thus interpreting factorizability as a locality condition he concluded that the quantum realm is non local For further discussions of Bell s theorem the Bell inequalities and non locality see Bell a b Clauser et al Clauser and Horne Shimony chapter Fine a b Redhead chapter Butterfield a Pitowsky Greenberger Horne and Zeilinger Greenberger Horne Shimony and Zeilinger Mermin and the entry on Bell s theorem Following Bell s work a broad consensus has it that the quantum realm involves some type of non locality for examples see Clauser and Horne Jarrett Shimony Redhead Butterfield a b Howard Healey Teller Clifton Butterfield and Redhead Clifton Maudlin Berkovitz a b a b and references therein But there is an ongoing controversy as to its exact nature and its compatibility with relativity theory One aspect of this controversy is over whether the analysis of factorizability and the different ways it could be violated may shed light on these issues Factorizability is equivalent to the conjunction of two conditions Jarrett Shimony Assuming independence see section any empirically adequate theory will have to violate OI or PI A common view has it that violations of PI involve a different type of non locality than violations of OI Violations of PI involve some type of action at a distance that is impossible to reconcile with relativity Shimony Redhead p whereas violations of OI involve some type of holism non separability and or passion at a distance that may be possible to reconcile with relativity Shimony Readhead pp Howard Teller On the other hand there is the view that the analysis above as well as other similar analyses of factorizability is immaterial for studying quantum non locality Butterfield a pp Jones and Clifton Maudlin pp and and even misleading Maudlin pp and On this alternative view the way to examine the nature of quantum non locality is to study the ontology postulated by the various interpretations of quantum mechanics and alternative quantum theories In sections we shall follow this methodology and discuss the nature of non locality postulated by several quantum theories The discussion in these sections will furnish the ground for evaluating the above controversy in section In orthodox quantum mechanics as well as in any other current quantum theory that postulates non locality i e influences between distant space like separated systems the influences between the distant measurement events in the EPR B experiment do not propagate continuously in space time They seem to involve action at a distance Yet a common view has it that these influences are due to some type of holism and or non separability of states of composite systems which are characteristic of systems in entangled states like the spin singlet state and which exclude the very possibility of action at a distance The paradigm case of action at a distance is the Newtonian gravitational force This force acts between distinct objects that are separated by some non vanishing spatial distance its influence is symmetric in that any two massive objects influence each other instantaneous and does not propagate continuously in space And it is frequently claimed or presupposed that such action at a distance could only exist between systems with separate states in non holistic universes i e universes in which the states of composite systems are determined by or supervene upon the states of their subsystems and the spacetime relations between them which are commonly taken to characterize the classical realm In sections and we shall briefly review the relevant notions of holism and non separability for a more comprehensive review see the entry on holism and nonseparability in physics and Healey In section we shall discuss the nature of holism and non separability in the quantum realm as depicted by various quantum theories Based on this discussion we shall consider whether the non local influences in the EPR B experiment constitute action at a distance In the literature there are various characterizations of holism Discussions of quantum non locality frequently focus on property holism where certain physical properties of objects are not determined by the physical properties of their parts The intuitive idea is that some intrinsic properties of wholes e g physical systems are not determined by the intrinsic properties of their parts and the spatiotemporal relations that obtain between these parts This idea can be expressed in terms of supervenience relations It is difficult to give a general precise specification of the terms intrinsic qualitative property and supervenience Intuitively a property of an object is intrinsic just in case that object has this property in and for itself and independently of the existence or the state of any other object A property is qualitative as opposed to individual if it does not depend on the existence of any particular object And the intrinsic qualitative properties of an object O supervene upon the intrinsic qualitative properties and relations of its parts and the spatiotemporal relations between them just in case there is no change in the properties and relations of O without a change in the properties and relations of its parts and or the spatiotemporal relations between them For attempts to analyze the term intrinsic property see for example Langton and Lewis and the entry on intrinsic vs extrinsic properties For a review of different types of supervenience see for example Kim McLaughlin and the entry on supervenience Paul Teller p proposes a related notion of holism relational holism which is characterized as the violation of the following condition Here by a non relational property Teller means an intrinsic property a p and by the supervenience of a relational property on the non relational properties of the relata he means that if two objects and bear a relation R to each other then necessarily if two further objects and have the same non relational properties then and will also bear the same relation R to each other p Teller b pp believes that spatiotemporal relations between objects supervene upon the objects intrinsic physical properties Thus he does not include the spatiotemporal relations in the supervenience basis This view is controversial however as many believe that spatiotemporal relations between objects are neither intrinsic nor supervene upon the intrinsic qualitative properties of these objects But if such supervenience does not obtain particularism will also be violated in classical physics and accordingly relational holism will fail to mark the essential distinction between the classical and the quantum realms Yet one may slightly revise Teller s definition of particularism as follows In what follows in this entry by relational holism we shall mean a violation of particularism Like holism there are various notions of non separability on offer The most common notion in the literature is state non separability i e the violation of the following condition The term wholly determined is vague But as before one may spell it out in terms of supervenience relations State separability obtains just in case each system possesses a separate state that determines its qualitative intrinsic properties and relations and the state of any composite system is supervenient upon the separate states of its subsystems Another notion of non separability is spatiotemporal non separability Inspired by Einstein Howard pp characterizes spatiotemporal non separability as the violation of the following separability condition A different notion of spatiotemporal non separability proposed by Healey see the entry on holism and nonseparability in physics is process non separability It is the violation of the following condition The quantum realm as depicted by all the quantum theories that postulate non locality i e influences between distant space like separated systems involves some type of non separability or holism In what follows in this section we shall consider the nature of the non separability and holism manifested by various interpretations of quantum mechanics On the basis of this consideration we shall address the question of whether these interpretations predicate the existence of action at a distance We start with the so called collapse theories In orthodox quantum mechanics normalized vectors in Hilbert spaces represent states of physical systems When the Hilbert space is of infinite dimension state vectors can be represented by functions the so called wave functions In any given basis there is a unique wave function that corresponds to the state vector in that basis For an entry level review of the highlights of the mathematical formalism and the basic principles of quantum mechanics see the entry on quantum mechanics Albert Hughes Part I and references therein for more advanced reviews see Bohm and Redhead chapters and the mathematical appendix For example the state of the L particle having z spin up i e spinning up about the z axis can be represented by the vector z up in the Hilbert space associated with the L particle and the state of the L particle having z spin down i e spinning down about the z axis can be represented by the orthogonal vector z down Particle pairs may be in a state in which the L particle and the R particle have opposite spins for instance either a state in which the L particle has z spin up and the R particle has z spin down or a state in which the L particle has z spin down and the R particle has z spin up Each of these states is represented by a tensor product of vectors in the Hilbert space of the particle pair z up L z down R and z down L z up R where the subscripts L and R refer to the Hilbert spaces associated with the L and the R particle respectively But particle pairs may also be in a superposition of these states i e a state that is a linear sum of the states and e g the state represented by In fact this is exactly the case in the spin singlet state In this state the particles are entangled in a non separable state i e a state that cannot be decomposed into a product of separate states of the L and the R particle in which according to the property assignment rules of orthodox quantum mechanics the particles do not possess any definite z spin or definite spin in any other direction Thus the condition of state separability fails The state of the particle pair which determines its intrinsic qualitative properties is not wholly determined by the separate states of the particles which determine their intrinsic qualitative properties Or more precisely the pair s state is not supervenient upon the separable states of the particles In particular the superposition state of the particle pair assigns a correlational property that dictates that the outcomes of ideal z spin measurements on both the L and the R particle will be anti correlated and this correlational property is not supervenient upon properties assigned by any separable states of the particles for more details see Healey For similar reasons the spin singlet state also involves property and relational holism for the above correlational property of the particle pair also fails to supervene upon the intrinsic qualitative properties of the particles and the spatiotemporal relations between them Furthermore the process that leads to each of the measurement outcomes is also non separable i e process separability fails see Healey and the entry on holism and nonseparability in physics This correlational property is also responsible for the action at a distance that the orthodox theory seems to postulate between the distant wings in the EPR B experiment Recall section that Einstein Podolsky and Rosen thought that this curious action at a distance reflects the incompleteness of this theory rather than a state of nature The EPR argument for the incompleteness of the orthodox theory is controversial But the orthodox theory seems to be incomplete for a different reason This theory postulates that in non measurement interactions the evolution of states obeys a linear and unitary equation of motion the so called Schr dinger equation see the entry on quantum mechanics according to which the particle pair in the EPR B experiment remains in an entangled state This equation of motion also dictates that in a spin measurement the pointers of the measurement apparatuses get entangled with the particle pair in a non separable state in which according to the theory s property assignment see below the indefiniteness of particles spins is transmitted to the pointer s position In this entangled state of the particle pair and the pointer the pointer lacks any definite position in contradiction to our experience of perceiving it pointing to either up or down The above problem commonly called the measurement problem arises in orthodox no collapse quantum mechanics from two features that account very successfully for the behavior of microscopic systems The linear dynamics of quantum states as described by the Schr dinger equation and the property assignment rule called eigenstate eigenvalue link According to the eigenstate eigenvalue link a physical observable i e a physical quantity of a system has definite value one of its eigenvalues just in case the system is in the corresponding eigenstate of that observable see the entry on quantum mechanics section Microscopic systems may be in a superposition state of spin components energies positions momenta as well as other physical observables Accordingly microscopic systems may be in a state of indefinite z spin energy position momentum and various other quantities The problem is that given the linear and unitary Schr dinger dynamics these indefinite quantities are also endemic in the macroscopic realm For example in a z spin measurement on a particle in a superposition state of z spin up and z spin down the position of the apparatus s pointer gets entangled with the indefinite z spin of the particle thus transforming the pointer into a state of indefinite position i e a superposition of pointing up and pointing down see Albert chapter and the entry on collapse theories section In particular in the EPR B experiment the L measurement causes the L apparatus pointer to get entangled with the particle pair transforming it into a state of indefinite position where up LA and down LA are the states of the L apparatus pointer displaying the outcomes z spin up and z spin down respectively Since the above type of indefiniteness is generic in orthodox no collapse quantum mechanics in this theory measurements typically have no definite outcomes in contradiction to our experience In order to solve this problem the orthodox theory postulates that in measurement interactions entangled states of measured systems and the corresponding measurement apparatuses do not evolve according to the Schr dinger equation Rather they undergo a collapse into product non entangled states where the systems involved have the relevant definite properties For example the entangled state of the particle pair and the L apparatus in the EPR B experiment may collapse into a product state in which the L particle comes to possess z spin up the R particle comes to possess z spin down and the L apparatus pointer displaying the outcome z spin up The problem is that in the orthodox theory the notions of measurement and the time duration and nature of state collapses remain completely unspecified As John Bell b p remarks the collapse postulate in this theory i e the postulate that dictates that in measurement interactions the entangled states of the relevant systems do not follow the Schr dinger equation but rather undergo a collapse is no more than supplementary imprecise verbal prescriptions This problem of accounting for our experience of perceiving definite measurement outcomes in orthodox quantum mechanics is an aspect of the more general problem of accounting for the classical like behavior of macroscopic systems in this theory The dynamical models for state vector reduction were developed to account for state collapses as real physical processes for a review of the collapse models and a detailed reference list see the entry on collapse theories The origin of the collapse models may be dated to Bohm and Bub s hidden variable theory and Pearle s spontaneous localization approach but the program has received its crucial impetus with the more sophisticated models developed by Ghirardi Rimini and Weber in see also Bell a and Albert and their consequent development by Pearle see also Ghirardi Pearle and Rimini and Butterfield et al Similarly to orthodox collapse quantum mechanics in the GRW models the quantum mechanical state of systems whether it is expressed by a vector or a wave function provides a complete specification of their intrinsic properties and relations The state of systems follows the Schr dinger equation except that it has a probability for spontaneous collapse independently of whether or not the systems are measured The chance of collapse depends on the size of the entangled systems in the earlier models the size of systems is predicated on the number of the elementary particles whereas in later models it is measured in terms of mass densities In any case in microscopic systems such as the particle pairs in the EPR B experiment the chance of collapse is very small and negligible the chance of spontaneous state collapse in such systems is cooked up so that it will occur on average every hundred million years or so This means that the chance that the entangled state of the particle pair in the EPR B experiment will collapse to a product state between the emission from the source and the first measurement is virtually zero In an earlier L measurement the state of the particle pair gets entangled with the state of the L measurement apparatus Thus the state of the pointer of the L apparatus evolves from being ready to measure a certain spin property to an indefinite outcome For instance in a z spin measurement the L apparatus gets entangled with the particle pair in a superposition state of pointing to up and pointing to down corresponding to the states of the L particle having z spin up and having z spin down and the R apparatus remains un entangled with these systems in the state of being ready to measure z spin Or formally where as before up AL and down AL denote the states of the L apparatus displaying the outcomes z spin up and down respectively and ready AR denotes the state of the R apparatus being ready to measure z spin In this state a gigantic number of particles of the L apparatus pointer are entangled together in the superposition state of being in the position corresponding to pointing to up and the position corresponding to pointing to down For assuming for simplicity of presentation that the position of all particles of the L apparatus pointer in the state of pointing to up down is the same the state can be rewritten as where pi denotes the i particle of the L apparatus pointer and up pi down pi is the state of the i particle being in the position corresponding to the outcome z spin up down The chance that at least one of the vast number of the pointer s particles will endure a spontaneous localization toward being in the position corresponding to either the outcome z spin up or the outcome z spin down within a very short time a split of a micro second is very high And since all the particles of the pointer and the particle pair are entangled with each other such a collapse will carry with it a collapse of the entangled state of the pointer of the L apparatus and the particle pair toward either or Thus the pointer will very quickly move in the direction of pointing to either the outcome z spin up or the outcome z spin down If as portrayed above the spontaneous localization of particles were to a precise position i e to the position corresponding to the outcome up or the outcome down the GRW collapse models would successfully resolve the measurement problem Technically speaking a precise localization is achieved by multiplying by a delta function centered on the position corresponding to either the outcome up or the outcome down see the entry on collapse theories section and Albert chapter where the probability of each of these mutually exhaustive possibilities is The problem is that it follows from the uncertainty principle see the entry on the uncertainty principle that in such localizations the momenta and the energies of the localized particles would be totally uncertain so that gases may spontaneously heat up and electrons may be knocked out of their orbits in contradiction to our experience To avoid this kind of problems GRW postulated that spontaneous localizations are characterized by multiplications by Gaussians that are centered around certain positions e g the position corresponding to either the outcome up or the outcome down in the state This may be problematic because in either case the state of the L apparatus pointer at what we characteristically conceive as the end of the L measurement would be a superposition of the positions up and down For although this superposition concentrates on either the outcome up or the outcome down i e the peak of the wave function that corresponds to this state concentrates on one of these positions it also has tails that go everywhere The state of the L apparatus is a superposition of an infinite number of different positions Thus it follows from the eigenstate eigenvalue link that the position observable of the L apparatus has no definite value at the end of the measurement But if the position observable having a definite value is indeed required in order for the L apparatus to have a definite location then the pointer will point to neither up nor down and the GRW collapse models will fail to reproduce the classical like behavior of such systems In later models GRW proposed to interpret the quantum state as a density of mass and they postulated that if almost all the density of mass of a system is concentrated in a certain region then the system is located in that region Accordingly pointers of measurement apparatuses do have definite positions at the end of measurement interactions Yet this solution has also given rise to a debate see Albert and Loewer Lewis a Ghirardi and Bassi Bassi and Ghirardi Clifton and Monton Frigg and Parker The exact details of the collapse mechanism and its characteristics in the GRW Pearle models have no significant implications for the type of non separability and holism they postulate all these models basically postulate the same kinds of non separability and holism as orthodox quantum mechanics see section And action at a distance between the L and the R wing will occur if the L measurement interaction a supposedly local event in the L wing causes some local events in the R wing such as the event of the pointer of the measurement apparatus coming to possess a definite measurement outcome during the R measurement That is action at a distance will occur if the L measurement causes the R particle to come to possess a definite z spin and this in turn causes the pointer of the R apparatus to come to possess the corresponding measurement outcome in the R measurement Furthermore if the L measurement causes the R particle to come to possess momentarily a definite position in the R wing then the action at a distance between the L and the R wing will occur independently of whether the R particle undergoes a spin measurement The above discussion is based on an intuitive notion of action at a distance and it presupposes that action at a distance is compatible with non separability and holism In the next section we shall provide more precise characterizations of action at a distance and in light of these characterizations reconsider the question of the nature of action at a distance in the GRW Pearle collapse models The action at a distance in the GRW Pearle models is different from the Newtonian action at a distance in various respects First in contrast to Newtonian action at a distance this action is independent of the distance between the measurement events Second while Newtonian action is symmetric the action in the GRW Pearle models is generally asymmetric Either the L measurement influences the properties of the R particle or the R measurement influences the properties of the L particle depending on which measurement occurs first the action will be symmetric when both measurements occur simultaneously Third and more important to our consideration in contrast to Newtonian action at a distance before the end of the L measurement the state of the L apparatus and the R particle is not separable and accordingly it is not clear that the influence is between separate existences as the case is supposed to be in Newtonian gravity This non separability of the states of the particle pair and the L measurement apparatus and more generally the fact that the non locality in collapse theories is due to state non separability has led a number of philosophers and physicists to think that wave collapses do not involve action at a distance Yet the question of whether there is an action at a distance in the GRW Pearle models and various other quantum theories depends on how we interpret the term action at a distance And as I will suggest below on a natural reading of Isaac Newton s and Samuel Clarke s comments concerning action at a distance there may be a peaceful coexistence between action at a distance and non separability and holism Newton famously struggled to find out the cause of gravity In a letter to Bentley dated January he said In a subsequent letter to Bentley dated February he added Samuel Clarke Newton s follower similarly struggled with the question of the cause of gravitational phenomenon In his famous controversy with Leibniz he said And he added Newton s and Clarke s comments suggest that for them gravity was a law governed phenomenon i e a phenomenon in which objects influence each other at a distance according to the Newtonian law of gravity and that this influence is due to some means which may be invisible and intangible and of a different nature from mechanism On this conception of action at a distance there seems to be no reason to exclude the possibility of action at a distance in the quantum realm even if that realm is holistic or the state of the relevant systems is non separable That is action at a distance may be characterized as follows We may alternatively characterize action at a distance in a more liberal way And while Newton and Clarke did not have an explanation for the action at a distance involved in Newtonian gravity on the above characterizations action at a distance in the quantum realm would be explained by the holistic nature of the quantum realm and or non separability of the states of the systems involved In particular if in the EPR B experiment the L apparatus pointer has a definite position before the L measurement and the R particle temporarily comes to possess definite position during the L measurement then the GRW Pearle models involve action at a distance and thus also action at a distance On the other hand if the R particle never comes to possess a definite position during the L measurement then the GRW Pearle models only involve action at a distance In David Bohm proposed a deterministic hidden variables quantum theory that reproduces all the observable predictions of orthodox quantum mechanics see Bohm Bohm Schiller and Tiomno Bell Dewdney Holland and Kyprianidis D rr Goldstein and Zangh a Albert Valentini Bohm and Hiley Holland Cushing and Cushing Fine and Goldstein for an entry level review see the entry on Bohmian mechanics and Albert chapter In contrast to orthodox quantum mechanics and the GRW Pearle collapse models in Bohm s theory wave functions always evolve according to the Schr dinger equation and thus they never collapse Wave functions do not represent the states of systems Rather they are states of a quantum field on configuration space that influences the states of systems Also particles always have definite positions and the positions of the particles and their wave function at a certain time jointly determine the trajectories of the particles at all future times Thus particles positions and their wave function determine the outcomes of any measurements so long as these outcomes are recorded in the positions of some physical systems as in any practical measurements There are various versions of Bohm s theory In the minimal Bohm theory formulated by Bell the wave function is interpreted as a guiding field which has no source or any dependence on the particles that deterministically governs the trajectories of the particles according to the so called guiding equation which expresses the velocities of the particles in terms of the wave function The states of systems are separable the state of any composite system is completely determined by the state of its subsystems and they are completely specified by the particles positions Spins and any other properties which are not directly derived from positions are not intrinsic properties of systems Rather they are relational properties that are determined by the systems positions and the guiding field In particular each of the particles in the EPR B experiment has dispositions to spin in various directions and these dispositions are relational properties of the particles they are generally determined by the guiding field and the positions of the particles relative to the measurement apparatuses and to each other To see the nature of non locality postulated by the minimal Bohm theory consider again the EPR B experiment and suppose that the measurement apparatuses are Stern Gerlach S G magnets which are prepared to measure z spin In any run of the experiment the measurement outcomes will depend on the initial positions of the particles and the order of the measurements Here is why In the minimal Bohm theory the spin singlet state denotes the relevant state of the guiding field rather than the intrinsic properties of the particle pair If the L measurement occurs before the R measurement the guiding field and the position of the L particle at the emission time jointly determine the disposition of the L particle to emerge from the S G device either above or below a plane aligned in the z direction where emerging above below the plane means that the L particle z spins up down about the z axis and the L apparatus pointer points to up down see Fig above All the L particles that are emitted above the center plane aligned orthogonally to the z direction like the L particles will be disposed to spin up and all the particles that are emitted below this plane like the L particles will be disposed to spin down Similarly if the R measurement occurs before the L measurement the guiding field and the position of the R particle at the emission time jointly determine the disposition of the R particle to emerge either above the z axis i e to z spin up or below the z axis i e to z spin down according to whether it is above or below the center plane independently of the position of the L particle along the z axis But the z spin disposition of the R particle changes immediately after an earlier z spin measurement on the L particle The R particles see Fig which were previously disposed to z spin up will now be disposed to z spin down i e to emerge below the center plane aligned orthogonally to the z axis and the R particles which were previously disposed to z spin down will now be disposed to z spin up i e to emerge above this center plane Yet the L measurement per se does not have any immediate influence on the state of the R particle The L measurement does not influence the position of the R particle or any other property that is directly derived from this position It only changes the guiding field and thus grounds new spin dispositions for the R particle But these dispositions are not intrinsic properties of the R particle Rather they are relational properties of the R particle which are grounded in the positions of both particles and the state of the guiding field Note that in the particular case in which the L particle is emitted above the center plane aligned orthogonally to the z axis and the R particle is emitted below that plane an earlier z spin on the L particle will have no influence on the outcome of a z spin on the R particle While there is no contiguous process to carry the influence of the L measurement outcome on events in the R wing the question of whether this influence amounts to action at a distance depends on the exact characterization of this term In contrast to the GRW Pearle collapse models the influence of the L measurement outcome on the intrinsic properties of the R particle is dependent on the R measurement Before this measurement occurs there are no changes in the R particle s intrinsic properties Yet the influence of the L measurement on the R particle is at a distance Thus the EPR B experiment as depicted by the minimal Bohm theory involves action at a distance but not action at a distance Bohm s theory portrays the quantum realm as deterministic Thus the single case objective probabilities i e the chances it assigns to individual spin measurement outcomes in the EPR B experiment are different from the corresponding quantum mechanical probabilities In particular while in quantum mechanics the chances of the outcomes up and down in an earlier L R spin measurement are both in Bohm s theory these chances are either one or zero Yet Bohm s theory postulates a certain distribution the so called quantum equilibrium distribution over all the possible positions of pairs with the same guiding field This distribution is computed from the quantum mechanical wave function and it is typically interpreted as ignorance over the actual position of the pair an ignorance that may be motivated by dynamical considerations and statistical patterns exhibited by ensembles of pairs with the same wave function for more details see the entry on bohmian mechanics section And the sum average or more generally the integration over this distribution reproduces all the quantum mechanical observable predictions What is the status of this probability postulate Is it a law of nature or a contingent fact if it is a fact at all The answers to these questions vary see Section Bohm Valentini a b Valentini and Westman D rr Goldstein and Zangh a b fn and Callender Turning to the question of non separability the minimal Bohm theory does not involve state non separability For recall that in this theory the state of a system does not consist in its wave function but rather in the system s position and the position of a composite system always factorizes into the positions of its subsystems Here the non separability of the wave function reflects the state of the guiding field This state propagates not in ordinary three space but in configuration space where each point specifies the configuration of both particles The guiding field of the particle pair cannot be factorized into the guiding field that governs the trajectory of the L particle and the guiding field that governs the trajectory of the R particle The evolution of the particles trajectories properties and dispositions is non separable and accordingly the particles trajectories properties and dispositions are correlated even when the particles are far away from each other and do not interact with each other Thus process separability fails In the non minimal Bohm theory the behavior of an N particle system is determined by its wave function and the intrinsic properties of the particles But in contrast to the minimal theory in the non minimal theory spins are intrinsic properties of particles The wave function always evolves according to the Schr dinger equation and it is interpreted as a quantum field which has no sources or any dependence on the particles The quantum field guides the particles via the quantum potential an entity which is determined from the quantum field and the evolution of properties is fully deterministic Like in the minimal Bohm theory the non separability of the wave function in the EPR B experiment dictates that the evolution of the particles trajectories properties and dispositions is non separable but the behavior of the particles is somewhat different In the earlier z spin measurement on the L particle the quantum potential continuously changes and this change induces an immediate change in the z spin of the R particle If the L particle starts to spin up down in the z direction the R particle will start to spin down up in the same direction see the little arrows in Fig Accordingly the L measurement induces instantaneous action at a distance between the L and the R wing Yet similarly to the minimal Bohm theory while the disposition of the R particle to emerge above or below the center plane aligned orthogonally to the z direction in a z spin measurement may change instantaneously the actual trajectory of the R particle along the z direction does not change before the measurement of the R particle s z spin occurs Only during the R measurement the spin and the position of the R particle get correlated and the R particle s trajectory along the z direction is dictated by the value of its intrinsic z spin Various objections have been raised against Bohm s theory for a detailed list and replies see the entry on Bohmian mechanics section One main objection is that in Bohmian mechanics the guiding field influences the particles but the particles do not influence the guiding field Another common objection is that the theory is involved with a radical type of non locality and that this type of non locality is incompatible with relativity While it may be very difficult or even impossible to reconcile Bohm s theory with relativity as is not difficult to see from the above discussion the type of non locality that the minimal Bohm theory postulates in the EPR B experiment does not seem more radical than the non locality postulated by the orthodox interpretation and the GRW Pearle collapse models Modal interpretations of quantum mechanics were designed to solve the measurement problem and to reconcile quantum mechanics with relativity They are no collapse typically indeterministic hidden variables theories Quantum mechanical states of systems which may be construed as denoting their states or information about these states always evolve according to unitary and linear dynamical equations the Schr dinger equation in the non relativistic case And the orthodox quantum mechanical state description of systems is supplemented by a set of properties which depends on the quantum mechanical state and which is supposed to be rich enough to account for the occurrence of definite macroscopic events and their classical like behavior but sufficiently restricted to escape all the known no hidden variables theorems For modal interpretations see van Fraassen chapter Kochen Krips Dieks Healey Bub Vermaas and Dieks Clifton Bacciagaluppi Bacciagaluppi and Hemmo Bub and Clifton Hemmo b Bacciagaluppi and Dickson Clifton Spekkens and Sipe a b Bene and Dieks and Berkovitz and Hemmo a b For an entry level review see the entry on modal interpretations of quantum theory For comprehensive reviews and analyses of modal interpretations see Bacciagaluppi Hemmo a chapters Dieks and Vermaas Vermaas and the entry on modal interpretations of quantum theory For the no hidden variables theorems see Kochen and Specker Greenberger Horne and Zeilinger Mermin and the entry on the Kochen Specker theorem Modal interpretations vary in their property assignment For simplicity we shall focus on modal interpretations in which the property assignment is based on the so called Schmidt biorthogonal decomposition theorem see Kochen Dieks and Healey Let S and S be systems associated with the Hilbert spaces HS and HS respectively There exist bases i and i for HS and HS respectively such that the state of S S can be expressed as a linear combination of the following form of vectors from these bases When the absolute values of the coefficients ci are all unequal the bases i and i and the above decomposition of S S are unique In that case it is postulated that S has a determinate value for each observable associated with HS with the basis i and S has a determinate value for each observable associated with HS with the basis i and ci provide the ignorance probabilities of the possible values that these observables may have For example suppose that the state of the L and the R particle in the EPR B experiment before the measurements is where and as before z up L z up R and z down L z down R denote the states of the L R particle having z spin up and z spin down respectively Then either the L particle spins up and the R particle spins down in the z direction or the L particle spins down and the R particle spins up in the z direction Thus in contrast to the orthodox interpretation and the GRW Pearle collapse models in modal interpretations the particles in the EPR B experiment may have definite spin properties even before any measurement occurs To see how the modal interpretation accounts for the curious correlations in EPR B type experiments let us suppose that the state of the particle pair and the measurement apparatuses at the emission time is where ready AL ready AR denotes the state of the L apparatus R apparatus being ready to measure z spin In this state the L and the R apparatus are in the definite state of being ready to measure z spin and similarly to the state the L and the R particle have definite z spin properties Either the L particle has z spin up and the R particle has z spin down or the L particle has z spin down and the R particle has z spin up where the probability of the realization of each of these possibilities is approximately In the earlier z spin measurement on the L particle the state of the particle pair and the apparatuses evolves to the state where as before up AL and down AL denote the states of the L apparatus pointing to the outcomes z spin up and z spin down respectively In this state either the L particle has a z spin up and the L apparatus points to up or the L particle has z spin down and the L apparatus points to down And again the probability of each of these possibilities is approximately The evolution of the properties from the state to the state depends on the dynamical laws In almost all modal interpretations if the particles have definite z spin properties before the measurements the outcomes of z spin measurements will reflect these properties That is the evolution of the properties of the particles and the measurement apparatuses will be deterministic so that the spin properties of the particles do not change in the L measurement and the pointer of the L apparatus comes to display the outcome that corresponds to the z spin property that the L particle had before the measurement If for example before the measurements the L and the R particle have respectively the properties z spin up and z spin down the earlier z spin measurement on the L particle will yield the outcome up and the spin properties of the particles will remain unchanged Accordingly a z spin measurement on the R particle will yield the outcome down Thus in this case the modal interpretation involves neither action at a distance nor action at a distance However if the measurement apparatuses are set up to measure x spin rather than z spin the evolution of the properties of the L particle and the L apparatus will be indeterministic As before the L measurement will not cause any change in the actual spin properties of the R particle But the L measurement outcome will cause an instant change in the spin dispositions of the R particle and the R measurement apparatus If for example the L measurement outcome is x spin up and the L particle comes to posses x spin up then the R particle and the R apparatus will have respectively the dispositions to possess x spin down and to display the outcome x spin down on a x spin measurement Thus like the minimal Bohm theory the modal interpretation may involve action at a distance in the EPR B experiment But unlike the minimal Bohm theory here spins are intrinsic properties of particles In the above modal interpretation property composition fails The properties of composite systems are not decomposable into the properties of their subsystems Consider again the state As separated systems i e in the decompositions of the composite system of the particle pair apparatuses into the L particle and the R particle apparatuses and into the R particle and the L particle apparatuses the L and the R particle have definite z spin properties But as subsystems of the composite system of the particle pair e g in the decomposition of the composite system of the particle pair apparatuses into the particle pair and the apparatuses they have no definite z spin properties A failure of property composition occurs also in the state where the L and the R particle have definite z spin properties both as separated systems and as subsystems of the particle pair though in contrast with in the range of the possible properties of the particles as separated systems and as subsystems of the pair is the same For nothing in the above property assignment implies that in the spin properties that the L particle has as a separated system and the spin properties that it has as a subsystem of the particle pair be the same The L particle may have z spin up as a separated system and z spin down as a subsystem of the particle pair Furthermore the dynamics of the properties that the L particle R particle has as a separated system and the dynamics of its properties as a subsystem of the particle pair are generally different Consider again the state In the earlier z spin measurement on the L particle the spin properties that the L particle has as a separated system follow a deterministic evolution the L particle has either z spin up or z spin down before and after the L measurement whereas as a subsystem of the particle pair the spin properties of the L particle follow an indeterministic evolution the L particle has no definite spin properties before the L measurement and either z spin up with approximately chance or z spin down with approximately chance after the L measurement The failure of property composition implies that the quantum realm as depicted by the above version of the modal interpretation involves state non separability and property and relational holism State separability fails because the state of the particle pair is not generally determined by the separate states of the particles Indeed as is easily shown the actual properties that the L and the R particle each has in the state are also compatible with product states in which the L and the R particle are not entangled Property and relational holism fail because in the state the properties of the pair do not supervene upon the properties of its subsystems and the spatiotemporal relations between them Furthermore process separability fails for similar reasons The failure of property composition in the modal interpretation calls for explanation It may be tempting to postulate that the properties that a system e g the L particle has as a separated system are the same as the properties that it has as a subsystem of composite systems But as Bacciagaluppi and Clifton a have shown such property assignment will be inconsistent It will be subject to a Kochen and Specker type contradiction Furthermore as Vermaas demonstrates the properties of composite systems and the properties of their subsystems cannot be correlated in ways compatible with the Born rule For what follows in the rest of this subsection the views of different authors differ widely Several variants of modal interpretations were developed in order to fix the problem of the failure of property composition The most natural explanation of the failure of property composition is that quantum states assign relational rather than intrinsic properties to systems see Kochen Bene and Dieks and Berkovitz and Hemmo a b For example in the relational modal interpretation proposed by Berkovitz and Hemmo a b the main idea is that quantum states assign properties to systems only relative to other systems and properties of a system that are related to different systems are generally different In particular in the state the L particle has a definite z spin property relative to the R particle the measurement apparatuses and the rest of the universe but as a subsystem of the particle pair it has no definite z spin relative to the measurement apparatuses and the rest of universe On this interpretation the properties of systems are highly non local by their very nature Properties like pointing to up and pointing to down are not intrinsic to the measurement apparatuses Rather they are relations between the apparatuses and other systems For example the property of the L apparatus pointing to up relative to the particle pair the R apparatus and the rest of the universe is not intrinsic to the L apparatus it is a relation between the L apparatus and the particle pair the R apparatus and the rest of the universe As such this property is highly non local It is located in neither the L wing nor any other subregion of the universe Yet due to the dynamical laws properties like the position of pointers of measurement apparatuses which appear to us to be local behave like local properties in any experimental circumstances and accordingly this radical type of non locality is unobservable for more details see Berkovitz and Hemmo b sections and Another way to try to explain the failure of property composition is to interpret the properties of composite systems as holistic non decomposable properties On this interpretation the z spin up property that the L particle has as a subsystem of the particle pair in the state is completely different from the z spin up property that the L particle has as a separated system and the use of the term z spin up in both cases is misleading for more details see Berkovitz and Hemmo a The relational and holistic interpretations of properties mark a radical shift from the standard interpretation of properties in orthodox quantum mechanics Other advocates of the modal interpretation have chosen not to follow this interpretation and opted for a modal interpretation that does not violate property composition While the property assignment above does not assume any preferred partition of the universe the partition of the universe into a particle pair and the rest of the universe is as good as the partition of the universe into the L particle and the rest of the universe proponents of property composition postulated that there is a preferred partition of the universe into atomic systems and accordingly a preferred factorization of the Hilbert space of the universe This preferred factorization is supposed to be the basis for the core property assignment Properties are prescribed to atomic systems according to a property assignment that is a generalization of the bi orthogonal decomposition property assignment And the properties of complex systems are postulated to be compositions of the properties of their atomic systems see the entry on modal interpretations of quantum theory section and Bacciagaluppi and Dickson The challenge for this atomic modal interpretation is to justify the assumption that there is a preferred partition of the universe and to provide some idea about how such factorization should look like Finally while the modal interpretation was designed to solve the measurement problem and reconcile quantum mechanics with special relativity it faces challenges on both accounts First in certain imprefect measurements where there are imprefections in the coupling between the measured system and the pointer of the measurement apparatus and or the pointer and the environment modal interpretations that are based on the Schmidt biorthogonal decomposition theorem and more generally the spectral decomposition theorem fail to account for definite measurement outcomes in contradiction to our experience see Bacciagaluppi and Hemmo and Bacciagaluppi For versions of the modal interpretations that seem to escape this problem see Van Fraassen Bub Bene and Dieks and Berkovitz and Hemmo a b Second as we shall see in section a number of no go theorems challenge the view that modal interpretations could be genuinely relativistic In Everett proposed a new no collapse interpretation of orthodox quantum mechanics see Everett a b Barrett the entry on Everett s relative state formulation of quantum mechanics the entry on the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics and references therein The Everett interpretation is a no collapse interpretation of quantum mechanics where the evolution of quantum states is always according to unitary and linear dynamical equations the Schr dinger equation in the non relativistic case In this interpretation quantum states are fundamentally relative Systems have relative states which are derivable from the various branches of the entangled states For example consider again In this quantum mechanical state the L apparatus is in the state of pointing to the outcome z spin up relative to the L particle being in the state z spin up the R particle being in the state z spin down and the R apparatus being ready to measure z spin and in the state of pointing to the outcome z spin down relative to the L particle being in the state z spin down the R particle being in the state z spin up and the R apparatus being ready to measure z spin Likewise the L particle is in the state z spin up relative to the L apparatus being in the state of pointing to the outcome z spin up the R particle being in the state z spin down and the R apparatus being ready to measure z spin and in the state z spin down relative to the L apparatus being in the state of pointing to the outcome z spin down the R particle being in the state z spin up and the R apparatus being ready to measure z spin And similarly mutatis mutandis for the relative state of the R particle and the R apparatus Everett s original formulation left the exact meaning of these relative states and their relations to observers experience and beliefs open and there have been different Everett like interpretations of these states Probably the most popular reading of Everett is the splitting worlds interpretation see DeWitt Everett s relative state formulation of quantum mechanics Barrett and references therein In the splitting worlds interpretation each of the branches of the state refers to a different class of worlds all of which are real where the states of the L apparatus R apparatus and the particles are all separable Class worlds in which the L particle is in the state z spin up the R particle is in the state z spin down the L apparatus is in the state of pointing to the outcome z spin up and the R apparatus in the state of being ready to measure z spin and class worlds in which the L particle is in the state z spin down the R particle is in the state z spin up the L apparatus is in the state of pointing to the outcome z spin down and the R apparatus is in the state of being ready to measure z spin More generally each term in state of the universe as represented in a certain preferred basis reflects the states of its systems in some class of worlds where the range of the different classes of worlds increases whenever the number of the terms in the quantum state in the preferred basis increases this process is called splitting The splitting worlds reading of Everett faces a number of challenges First supporters of the Everett interpretation frequently motivate their interpretation by arguing that it postulates the existence of neither a controversial wave collapse nor hidden variables and it leaves the simple and elegant mathematical structure of quantum mechanics intact But the splitting worlds interpretation adds extra structure to no collapse orthodox quantum mechanics Further this interpretation marks a radical shift from orthodox quantum mechanics A scientific theory is not constituted only by its mathematical formalism but also by the ontology it postulates the way it depicts the physical realm and the way it accounts for our experience The many parallel worlds ontology of the splitting worlds interpretation and its account of our experience are radically different from the ontology of the intended interpretation of orthodox quantum mechanics and its account for our experience Second relative states are well defined in any basis and the question arises as to which basis should be preferred and the motivation for selecting one particular basis over others Third in the splitting worlds interpretation each of the worlds in the universe may split into two or more worlds and the problem is that similarly to the collapse in orthodox collapse quantum mechanics there are no clear criteria for when a splitting occurs and how long it takes Fourth there is the question of how the splitting worlds interpretation accounts for the statistical predictions of the orthodox theory In the Everett like interpretations in general and in the splitting worlds interpretation in particular all the possible measurement outcomes in the EPR B experiment are realized and may be observed Thus the question arises as to the meaning of probabilities in this interpretation For example what is the meaning of the statement that in the state see section the probability of the L measurement apparatus pointing to the outcome up in an earlier z spin measurement on the L particle is approximately In the splitting worlds interpretation the probability of that outcome appears to be Furthermore setting aside the problem of interpretation there is also the question of whether the splitting worlds interpretation and more generally Everett like interpretations can account for the particular values of the quantum probabilities of measurement outcomes Everett claimed to derive the Born probabilities in the context of his interpretation But this derivation has been controversial For discussions of the meaning of probabilities or more precisely the meaning of the coefficients of the various terms in quantum states in Everett like interpretations see Butterfield Lockwood a b Saunders Vaidman Barnum et al Bacciagaluppi Gill Hemmo and Pitowsky Wallace a b Greaves and Saunders Other readings of Everett include the many minds interpretation Albert and Loewer Barrett chapter the consistent histories approach Gell Mann and Hartle the Everett like relational interpretation Saunders Mermin and what may be called the many structures interpretation Wallace c While these readings address more or less successfully the problems of the preferred basis and splitting except for the many minds interpretation of Albert and Loewer the question of whether there could be a satisfactory interpretation of probabilities in the context of these theories and the adequacy of the derivation of the Born probabilities are still a controversial issue see Deutsch Wallace Lewis Graves Saunders Hemmo and Pitowsky and Price What kind of non locality do Everett like interpretations involve Unfortunately the answer to this question is not straightforward as it depends on one s particular reading of the Everett interpretation Indeed all the above readings of Everett seem to treat the no collapse wave function of the universe as a real physical entity that reflects the non separable state of the universe and accordingly they involve state non separability But one may reasonably expect that different readings depict different pictures of physical reality and accordingly might postulate different kinds of non locality Thus any further analysis of the type of non locality postulated by each of these readings requires a detailed study of their ontology which we plan to conduct in future updates of this entry For example the question of action at a distance in the EPR B experiment may arise in the context of the splitting worlds interpretation but not in the context of Albert and Loewer s many minds interpretation Albert and Loewer s interpretation takes the bare no collapse orthodox quantum mechanics to be the complete theory of the physical realm Accordingly the L apparatus in the state does not display any definite outcome Yet in order to account for our experience of a classical like world where at the end of measurements observers are typically in mental states of perceiving definite outcomes the many minds interpretation appeals to a dualism of mind body Each observer is associated with a continuous infinity of non physical minds And while the physical state of the world evolves in a completely deterministic manner according to the Schr dinger evolution and the pointers of the measurement apparatuses in the EPR B experiment display no definite outcomes states of minds evolve in a genuinely indeterministic fashion so as to yield an experience of perceiving definite measurement outcomes For example consider again the state While in a first z spin L measurement this state evolves deterministically into the state minds of observers evolve indeterministically into either the state of perceiving the outcome z spin up or the state of perceiving the outcome z spin down with the usual Born rule probabilities approximately chance for each of these outcomes Since in this state the L particle has no definite spin properties and the L apparatus points to no definite measurement outcome and since in the later z spin measurement on the R particle the R particle does not come to possess any definite spin properties and the R apparatus points to no definite spin outcome the question of whether there is action at a distance between the L particle and the L apparatus on the one hand and the R particle and the R apparatus on the other does not arise In all the above interpretations of quantum mechanics the failure of factorizability i e the failure of the joint probability of the measurement outcomes in the EPR B experiment to factorize into their single probabilities involves non separability holism and or some type of action at a distance As we shall see below non factorizability also implies superluminal causal dependence according to certain accounts of causation First as is not difficult to show the failure of factorizability implies superluminal causation according to various probabilistic accounts of causation that satisfy Reichenbach s section principle of the common cause for a review of this principle see the entry on Reichenbach s principle of the common cause Here is why Reichenbach s principle may be formulated as follows PCC Principle of the Common Cause For any correlation between two distinct events which do not cause each other there is a common cause that screens them off from each other Or formally If distinct events x and y are correlated i e and they do not cause each other then their common cause CC x y screens them off from each other i e Accordingly CC x y renders x and y probabilistically independent and the joint probability of x and y factorizes upon CC x y The above formulation of PCC is mainly intended to cover cases in which x and y have no partial non common causes But PCC can be generalized as follows PCC The joint probability of any distinct correlated events x and y which are not causally connected to each other factorizes upon the union of their partial separate causes and their common cause That is let CC x y denote the common causes of x and y and PC x and PC y denote respectively their partial causes Then the joint probability of x and y factorizes upon the Union of their Causal Pasts henceforth FactorUCP i e on the union of PC x PC y and CC x y FactorUCP PPC x PC y CC x y x y PPC x CC x y x PPC y CC x y y Like PCC the basic idea of FactorUCP is that the objective probabilities of events that do not cause each other are determined by their causal pasts and given these causal pasts they are probabilistically independent of each other As is not difficult to see factorizability is a special case of FactorUCP That is to obtain factorizability from FactorUCP substitute for CC x y l for PC x and r for PC y FactorUCP and the assumption that the probabilities of the measurement outcomes in the EPR B experiment are determined by the pair s state and the settings of the measurement apparatuses jointly imply factorizability Thus given this later assumption the failure of factorizability implies superluminal causation between the distant outcomes in the EPR B experiment according to any account of causation that satisfies FactorUCP for some examples of such accounts see Butterfield and Berkovitz a b section b Superluminal causation between the distant outcomes also exists according to various counterfactual accounts of causation including accounts that do not satisfy FactorUCP In particular in Lewis s influential account counterfactual dependence between distinct events implies causal dependence between them And as Butterfield b and Berkovitz b demonstrate the violation of Factorizability involves a counterfactual dependence between the distant measurement outcomes in the EPR B experiment But the violation of factorizability does not imply superluminal causation according to some other accounts of causation In particular in process accounts of causation there is no superluminal causation in the EPR B experiment In such accounts causal dependence between events is explicated in terms of continuous processes in space and time that transmit marks or conserved quantities from the cause to the effect see Salmon chapters and Dowe the entry on causal processes and references therein Thus recalling sections and that none of the interpretations of quantum mechanics and alternative quantum theories postulates any direct continuous process between the distant measurement events in the EPR B experiment there is no superluminal causation between them according to process accounts of causation Whether or not the non locality predicted by quantum theories may be classified as action at a distance or superluminal causation the question arises as to whether this non locality could be exploited to allow superluminal i e faster than light signaling of information This question is of particular importance for those who interpret relativity as prohibiting any such superluminal signaling We shall return to discuss this interpretation in section Superluminal signaling would require that the state of nearby controllable physical objects say a keyboard in my computer superluminally influence distant observable physical phenomena e g a pattern on a computer screen light years away The influence may be deterministic or indeterministic but in any case it should cause a detectable change in the statistics of some distant physical quantities It is commonly agreed that in quantum phenomena superluminal signaling is impossible in practice Moreover many believe that such signaling is excluded in principle by the so called no signaling theorem for proofs of this theorem see Eberhard Ghirardi Rimini and Weber Jordan Shimony Redhead pp and It is thus frequently claimed with respect to EPR B experiments that there is no such thing as a Bell telephone namely a telephone that could exploit the violation of the Bell inequalities for superluminal signaling of information The no signaling theorem demonstrates that orthodox quantum mechanics excludes any possibility of superluminal signaling in the EPR B experiment According to this theory no controllable physical factor in the L wing such as the setting of the L measurement apparatus can take advantage of the entanglement between the systems in the L and the R wing to influence the statistics of the measurement outcomes or any other observable in the R wing As we have seen in section the orthodox theory is at best incomplete Thus the fact that it excludes superluminal signaling does not imply that other quantum theories or interpretations of the orthodox theory also exclude such signaling Yet if the orthodox theory is empirically adequate as the consensus has it its statistical predictions obtain and accordingly superluminal signaling will be excluded as a matter of fact for if this theory is empirically adequate any quantum theory will have to reproduce its statistics including the exclusion of any actual superluminal signaling But the no signaling theorem does not demonstrate that superluminal signaling would be impossible if orthodox quantum mechanics were not empirically adequate Furthermore this theorem does not show that superluminal signaling is in principle impossible in the quantum realm as depicted by other theories which actually reproduce the statistics of orthodox quantum mechanics but do not prohibit in theory the violation of this statistics In sections we shall consider the in principle possibility of superluminal signaling in certain collapse and no collapse interpretations of quantum mechanics But first we need to consider the necessary and sufficient conditions for superluminal signaling To simplify things in our discussion we shall focus on non factorizable models of the EPR B experiment that satisfy independence i e the assumption that the distribution of the states is independent of the settings of the measurement apparatuses Superluminal signaling in the EPR B experiment would be possible in theory just in case the value of some controllable physical quantity in the nearby wing could influence the statistics of measurement outcomes in the distant wing And in non factorizable models that satisfy independence this could happen just in case the following conditions obtained Four comments i In controllable probabilistic dependence the term probabilities of measurement outcomes refers to the model probabilities i e the probabilities that the states prescribe for measurement outcomes ii Our discussion in this entry focuses on models of the EPR B experiment in which probabilities of measurement outcomes depend only on the pair s state and the settings of the measurement apparatuses to measure certain properties In such models parameter dependence i e the dependence of the probability of the distant measurement outcome on the setting of the nearby measurement apparatus is a necessary and sufficient condition for controllable probabilistic dependence But recall footnote that in some models of the EPR B experiment in addition to the pair s state and the setting of the L R measurement apparatus there are other local physical quantities that may be relevant for the probability of the L R measurement outcome In such models parameter dependence is not a necessary condition for controllable probabilistic dependence Some other physical quantities in the nearby wing may be relevant for the probability of the distant measurement outcome That is let and denote all the relevant local physical quantities other than the settings of the measurement apparatuses that may be relevant for the probability of the L and the R outcome respectively Then controllable probabilistic dependence would obtain if for some pairs states L setting l R setting r and local physical quantities and P l r yr P l r yr obtained For the relevance of such models to the question of the in principle possibility of superluminal signalling in some current interpretations of quantum mechanics see sections and iii The quantum equilibrium distribution will not be the same in all models of the EPR B experiment for in general the states will not be the same in different models iv In models that actually violate both controllable probabilistic dependence and distribution the occurrence of controllable probabilistic dependence would render the actual distribution of states as non equilbrium distribution Thus if controllable probabilistic dependence occurred in such models the actual distribution of states would satisfy distribution The argument for the necessity of controllable probabilistic dependence and distribution is straightforward Granted independence if the probabilistic dependence of the distant outcome on a nearby physical quantity is not controllable there can be no way to manipulate the statistics of the distant outcome so as to deviate from the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics Accordingly superluminal transmission of information will be impossible even in theory And if distribution does not hold i e if the quantum equilibrium distribution holds controllable probabilistic dependence will be of no use for superluminal transmission of information For averaging over the model probabilities according to the quantum equilbrium distribution the model will reproduce the statistics of orthodox quantum mechanics That is the distribution of the states will be such that the probabilistic dependence of the distant outcome on the nearby controllable factor will be washed out In some states the nearby controllable factor will raise the probability of the distant outcome and in others it will decrease this probability so that on average the overall statistics of the distant outcome will be independent of the nearby controllable factor i e the same as the statistics of orthodox quantum mechanics Accordingly superluminal signaling will be impossible The argument for the sufficiency of these conditions is also straightforward If distribution held it would be possible in theory to arrange ensembles of particle pairs in which controllable probabilistic dependence would not be washed out and accordingly the statistics of distant outcomes would depend on the nearby controllable factor For a proof that these conditions are sufficient for superluminal signaling in certain deterministic hidden variables theories see Valentini Note that the necessary and sufficient conditions for superluminal signaling are different in models that do not exclude in theory the violation of independence In such models controllable probabilistic dependence is not a necessary condition for superluminal signaling The reasoning is as follows Consider any empirically adequate model of the EPR B experiment in which the pair s state and the settings of the measurement apparatuses are the only relevant factors for the probabilities of measurement outcomes and the quantum equilibrium distribution is independent In such a model parameter independence implies the failure of controllable probabilistic dependence yet the violation of independence would imply the possibility of superluminal signaling If independence failed a change in the setting of the nearby measurement apparatus would cause a change in the distribution of the states and a change in this distribution would induce a change in the statistics of the distant space like separated measurement outcome Leaving aside models that violate independence we now turn to consider the prospects of controllable probabilistic dependence and distribution starting with no collapse interpretations Bohm s theory involves parameter dependence and thus controllable probabilistic dependence The probabilities of distant outcomes depend on the setting of the nearby apparatus In some pairs states i e in some configurations of the positions of the particle pair a change in the apparatus setting of the earlier say L measurement will induce an immediate change in the probability of the R outcome e g the probability of R outcome z spin up will be if the L apparatus is set to measure z spin and if the L apparatus is switched off see section Thus the question of superluminal signaling turns on whether distribution obtains Now recall section that Bohm s theory reproduces the quantum statistics by postulating the quantum equilibrium distribution over the positions of particles If this distribution is not an accidental fact about our universe but rather obtains as a matter of law superluminal signaling will be impossible in principle D rr Goldstein and Zangh a b fn argue that while the quantum equilibrium distribution is not a matter a law other distributions will be possible but atypical Thus they conclude that although superluminal signaling is not impossible in theory it may occur only in atypical worlds On the other hand Valentini a b and Valentini and Westman argue that there are good reasons to think that our universe may well have started off in a state of quantum non equilibrium and is now approaching gradually a state of equilibrium so that even today some residual non equilibrium must be present Yet even if such residual non equilbrium existed the question is whether it would be possible to access any ensemble of systems in a non equilbrium distribution The presence or absence of parameter independence and accordingly the presence or absence of controllable probabilistic dependence in the modal interprtation is a matter of controversy perhaps due in part to the multiplicity of versions of this interpretation Whether or not modal interpretations involve parameter dependence would probably depend on the dynamics of the possessed properties At least some of the current modal interpretations seem to involve no parameter dependence But as the subject editor pointed out to the author some think that the no go theorem for relativistic modal interpretation due to Dickson and Clifton implies the existence of parameter dependence in all the interpretations to which this theorem is applicable Do modal interpretations satisfy distribution The prospects of this condition depend on whether the possessed properties that the modal interpretation assigns in addition to the properties prescribed by the orthodox interpretation are controllable If these properties were controllable at least in theory distribution would be possible For example if the possessed spin properties that the particles have at the emission from the source in the EPR B experiment were controllable then distribution would be possible The common view seems to be that these properties are uncontrollable In the GRW Pearle collapse models wave functions represent the most exhaustive complete specification of states of individual systems Thus pairs prepared with the same wave function have always the same state a state that represents their quantum equilbrium distribution for the EPR B experiment Accordingly distribution fails Do these models involve controllable probabilistic dependence Recall section that there are several models of state reduction in the literature One of these models is the so called non linear Continuous Stochastic Localization CSL models see Pearle Ghirardi Pearle and Rimini Butterfield et al and Ghirardi et al Butterfield et al argue that in these models there is a probabilistic dependence of the outcome of the R measurement on the process that leads to the earlier outcome of the L measurement In these models the process leading to the L outcome either z spin up or z spin down depends on the interaction between the L particle and the L apparatus which results in an entangled state and the specific realization of the stochastic process that strives to collapse this macroscopic superposition into a product state in which the L apparatus displays a definite outcome And the probability of the R outcome depends on this process For example if this process is one that gives rise to a z spin up or renders that outcome more likely the probability of R outcome z spin up is more likely to be and if this process is one that gives rise to a z spin down or renders that outcome more likely the probability of R outcome z spin down is more likely to be The question is whether there are controllable factors that influence the probability of realizations of stochastic processes that lead to a specific L outcome so that it would be possible to increase or decrease the probability of the R outcome If such factors existed controllable probabilistic dependence would be possible at least in theory And if this kind of controllable probabilistic dependence existed distribution would also obtain for if such dependence existed the actual distribution of pairs states in which the pair always have the same state the quantum mechanical state would cease to be the quantum equilbrium distribution In section we discussed the question of the in principle controllability of local measurement processes and in particular the probability of their outcome and the implications of such controllability for the in principle possibility of superluminal signaling in the context of the CSL models But this question is not specific to the CSL model and more generally the dynamical models for state vector reduction It seems likely to arise also in other quantum theories that model measurements realistically Here is why Real measurements take time And during that time some physical variable other than the state of the measured system and the setting of the measurement apparatus might influence the chance i e the single case objective probability of the measurement outcome In particular during the L measurement in the EPR B experiment the chance of the L outcome z spin up down might depend on the value of some physical variable in the L wing other than the state of the particle pair and the setting of the L measurement apparatus If so it will follow from the familiar perfect anti correlation of the singlet state that the chance of R outcome z spin up down will depend on the value of such variable for details see Kronz a b Jones and Clifton pp and Berkovitz a section Thus if the value of such a variable were controllable controllable probabilistic dependence would obtain If superluminal signaling were possible in the EPR B experiment in any of the above theories it would not require any continuous process in spacetime to mediate the influences between the two distant wings Indeed in all the current quantum theories in which the probability of the R outcome depends on some controllable physical variable in the L wing this dependence is not due to a continuous process Rather it is due to some type of action or to use Shimony s terminology passion at a distance which is the result of the holistic nature of the quantum realm the non separability of the state of entangled systems or the non separable nature of the evolution of the properties of systems In sections we considered the nature of quantum non locality as depicted by theories that violate factorizability i e the assumption that the probability of joint measurement outcomes factorizes into the single probabilities of these outcomes Recalling section factorizability can be analyzed into a conjunction of two conditions OI outcome independence the probability of a distant measurement outcome in the EPR B experiment is independent of the nearby measurement outcome and PI parameter independence the probability of a distant measurement outcome in the EPR B experiment is independent of the setting of the nearby measurement apparatus Bohm s theory violates PI whereas other mainstream quantum theories satisfy this condition but violate OI The question arises as to whether violations of PI involve a different kind of non locality than violations of OI So far our methodology was to study the nature of quantum non locality by analyzing the way various quantum theories account for the curious correlations in the EPR B experiment In this section we shall focus on the question of whether quantum non locality can be studied in a more general way namely by analyzing the types of non locality involved in violations of PI and in violations of OI independently of how these violations are realized It is frequently argued or maintained that violations of OI involve state non separability and or some type of holism whereas violations of PI involve action at a distance For notable examples Howard argues that spatiotemporal separability see section implies OI and accordingly a violation of it implies spatiotemporal non separability Teller argues that particularism see section implies OI and thus a violation of it implies relational holism and Jarrett argues that a violation of PI involves some type of action at a distance These views are controversial however First as we have seen in section in quantum theories the violation of either of these conditions involves some type of non separability and or holism Second the explicit attempts to derive OI from separability or particularism seem to rely implicitly on some locality conditions Maudlin p and Berkovitz a section argue that Howard s precise formulation of spatiotemporal separability embodies both separability and locality conditions and Berkovitz a section argues that Teller s derivation of OI from particularism implicitly relies on locality conditions Thus the violation of OI per se does not imply non separability or holism Third a factorizable model i e model that satisfies OI may be non separable Berkovitz b section Thus OI cannot be simply identified with separability Fourth Howard s spatiotemporal separability condition see section requires that states of composite systems be determined by the states of their subsystems In particular spatiotemporal separability requires that joint probabilities of outcomes be determined as some function of the single probabilities of these outcomes Winsberg and Fine object that as a separability condition OI arbitrarily restricts this function to be a product function And they argue that on a weakened formalization of separability a violation of OI is compatible with separability Fogel agrees that Winsberg and Fine s weakened formalization of separability is correct but argues that when supplemented by a certain isotropy condition OI implies this weakened separability condition Fogel believes that his suggested isotropy condition is very plausible but as he acknowledges this condition involves a nontrivial measurement context independence Fifth as the analysis in section demonstrates violations of OI might involve action at a distance Also while the minimal Bohm theory violates PI and arguably some modal interpretations do not the type of action at a distance they postulate namely action at a distance see section is similar In both cases an earlier spin measurement in say the L wing does not induce any immediate change in the intrinsic properties of the R particle The L measurement only causes an immediate change in the dispositions of the R particle a change that may influence the behavior of the R particle in future spin measurements in the R wing But this change of dispositions does not involve any change of local properties in the R wing as these dispositions are relational rather than intrinsic properties of the R particle Furthermore the action at a distance predicated by the minimal Bohm theory is weaker than the one predicated by orthodox collapse quantum mechanics and the GRW Pearle collapse models for in contrast to the minimal Bohm theory in these theories the measurement on the L particle induces a change in the intrinsic properties of the R particle independently of whether or not the R particle undergoes a measurement Thus if the R particle comes to possess momentarily a definite position the EPR B experiment as described by these theories involves action at a distance a stronger kind of action than the action at a distance predicated by the minimal Bohm theory It was also argued notably by Jarrett and and Shimony that in contrast to violations of OI violations of PI may give rise at least in principle to superluminal signaling Indeed as is not difficult to see from section in theories that satisfy independence there is an asymmetry between failures of PI and failures of OI with respect to superluminal signaling whereas distribution and the failure of PI are sufficient conditions for the in principle possibility of superluminal signaling distribution and the failure of OI are not Thus the prospects of superluminal signaling look better in parameter dependent theories i e theories that violate PI Yet as we have seen in section if the Bohmian quantum equilbrium distribution obtains then Bohm s theory the paradigm of parameter dependent theories prohibits superluminal signaling And if this distribution is obtained as a matter of law then Bohm s theory prohibits superluminal signaling even in theory Furthermore as we remarked in section if the in principle possibility of violating independence is not excluded superluminal signaling may exist in theories that satisfy PI and violate OI In fact as section seems to suggest the possibility of superluminal signaling in theories that satisfy PI but violate OI cannot be discounted even when independence is impossible Jarrett Ballentine and Jarrett and Shimony hold that superluminal signaling is incompatible with relativity theory Accordingly they conclude that violations of PI are incompatible with relativity theory whereas violations of OI may be compatible with this theory Furthermore Sutherland argues that deterministic relativistic parameter dependent theories i e relativistic deterministic theories that violate PI would plausibly require retro causal influences and in certain experimental circumstances this type of influences would give rise to causal paradoxes i e inconsistent closed causal loops where effects undermine their very causes And Arntzenius argues that all relativistic parameter dependent theories are impossible on pain of causal paradoxes That is he argues that in certain experimental circumstances any relativistic parameter dependent theory would give rise to closed causal loops in which violations of PI could not obtain It is noteworthy that the view that relativity per se is incompatible with superluminal signaling is disputable for more details see section Anyway recalling section if distribution is excluded as a matter of law it will be impossible even in theory to exploit the violation of PI to give rise to superluminal signaling in which case the possibility of relativistic parameter dependent theories could not be discounted on the basis of superluminal signaling Furthermore as mentioned in section and the in principle possibility of superluminal signaling in theories that satisfy PI and violate OI cannot be excluded a priori Thus if relativity theory excludes superluminal signaling the argument from superluminal signaling may also be applied to exclude the possibility of some relativistic outcome dependent theories Finally Berkovitz argues that Arntzenius s argument for the impossibility of relativistic theories that violate PI is based on assumptions about probabilities that are common in linear causal situations but are unwarranted in causal loops and that the real challenge for these theories is that in such loops their predictive power is undermined for more details see section In various counterfactual and probabilistic accounts of causation violations of PI entail superluminal causation between the setting of the nearby measurement apparatus and the distant measurement outcome whereas violations of OI entail superluminal causation between the distant measurement outcomes see Butterfield b Berkovitz b section Thus it seems that theories that violate PI postulate a different type of superluminal causation than theories that violate OI Yet as Berkovitz b section argues the violation of PI in Bohm s theory does involve some type of outcome dependence which may be interpreted as a generalization of the violation of OI In this theory the specific R measurement outcome in the EPR B experiment depends on the specific L measurement outcome For any three different directions x y z if the probabilities of x spin up and y spin up are non zero the probability of R outcome z spin up will generally depend on whether the L outcome is x spin up or y spin up Yet due to the determinism that Bohm s theory postulates OI trivially obtains Put it another way OI does not reflect all the types of outcome independence that may exist between distant outcomes Accordingly the fact that a theory satisfies OI does not entail that it does not involve some other type of outcome dependence Indeed in all the current quantum theories that violate factorizability there are correlations between distant specific measurement outcomes correlations that may well be interpreted as an indication of counterfactual superluminal causation between these outcomes Parameter dependence PI postulates that in the EPR B experiment the probability of the later distant measurement outcome depends on the setting of the apparatus of the nearby earlier measurement It may be tempting to assume that this dependence is due to a direct influence of the nearby setting on the probability of the distant outcome But a little reflection on the failure of PI in Bohm s theory which is the paradigm for parameter dependence demonstrates that the setting of the nearby apparatus per se has no influence on the distant measurement outcome Rather it is because the setting of the nearby measurmenent apparatus influences the nearby measurement outcome and the nearby outcome influences the distant outcome that the setting of the nearby apparatus can have an influence on the distant outcome For as is not difficult to see from the analysis of the nature of non locality in the minimal Bohm theory see section the setting of the apparatus of the nearby earlier measurement in the EPR B experiment influences the outcome the nearby measurement and this outcome influences the guiding field of the distant particle and accordingly the outcome of a measurement on that particle While the influence of the nearby setting on the nearby outcome is necessary for parameter dependence it is not sufficient for it In all the current quantum theories the probabilities of joint outcomes in the EPR B experiment depend on the settings of both measurement apparatuses The probability that the L outcome is l spin up and the R outcome is r spin up and the probability that the L outcome is l spin up and the R outcome is r spin down both depend on l r i e the distance between the angles l and r In theories in which the sum of these joint probabilities is invariant with respect to the value of l r parameter independence obtains for all pairs states L setting l and R settings r and r L outcome xl and R outcomes yr and yr Parameter dependence is a violation of this invariance condition The focus of this entry has been on exploring the nature of the non local influences in the quantum realm as depicted by quantum theories that violate factorizability i e theories in which the joint probability of the distant outcomes in the EPR B experiment do not factorize into the product of the single probabilities of these outcomes The motivation for this focus was that granted plausible assumptions factorizability must fail see section and its failure implies some type of non locality see sections But if any of these plausible assumptions failed it may be possible to account for the EPR B experiment and more generally for all other quantum phenomena without postulating any non local influences Let us then consider the main arguments for the view that quantum phenomena need not involve non locality In arguments for the failure of factorizability it is presupposed that the distant measurement outcomes in the EPR B experiment are real physical events Recall section that in Albert and Loewer s many minds interpretation this is not the case In this interpretation definite measurement outcomes are typically not physical events In particular the pointers of the measurement apparatuses in the EPR B experiment do not display any definite outcomes Measurement outcomes in the EPR B experiment exist only as non physical mental states in observers minds which are postulated to be non physical entities So sacrificing some of our most fundamental presuppositions about the physical reality and assuming a controversial mind body dualism the many minds interpretation of quantum mechanics does not postulate any action at a distance or superluminal causation between the distant wings of the EPR B experiment Yet as quantum mechanical states of systems are assumed to reflect their physical states the many minds theory does postulate some type of non locality namely state non separability and property and relational holism Another way to get around Bell s argument for non locality in the EPR B experiment is to construct a model of this experiment that satisfies factorizability but violates independence i e the assumption that the distribution of all the possible pairs states in the EPR B experiment is independent of the measured quantities In section we mentioned two possible causal explanations for the failure of independence The first is to postulate that pairs states and apparatus settings share a common cause which correlates certain types of pairs states with certain types of settings e g states of type are correlated with settings of type l and r whereas states of type are correlated with settings of type l and r etc As we noted thinking about all the various ways one can measure properties this explanation seems conspiratorial Furthermore it runs counter to one of the most fundamental presuppositions of empirical science namely that in experiments preparations of sources and settings of measurement apparatuses are typically independent of each other The second possible explanation is to postulate causation from the measurement events backward to the source at the emission time For advocates of this way out of non locality see Costa de Beauregard Sutherland and Price chapters and Maudlin p argues that theories that postulate such causal mechanism are inconsistent Berkovitz section argues that Maudlin s line of reasoning is based on unwarranted premises Yet as we shall see in section this way out of non locality faces some challenges Furthermore while a violation of independence provides a way out of Bell s theorem it does not necessarily imply locality for the violation of independence is compatible with the failure of factorizability A third way around non locality is to exploit the inefficiency of measurement devices or more generally measurement set ups In any actual EPR B experiment many of the particle pairs emitted from the source fail to be detected so that only a sample of the particle pairs is observed Assuming that the observed samples are not biased it is now generally agreed that the statistical predictions of orthodox quantum mechanics have been vindicated for a review of these experiments see Redhead section But if this assumption is abandoned there are perfectly local causal explanations for the actual experimental results Clauser and Horne Fine b a Many believe that this way out of non locality is ad hoc at least in light of our current knowledge Moreover this strategy would fail if the efficiency of measurement devices exceeded a certain threshold for more details see Fine a Maudlin chapter Larsson and Semitecolos and Larsson Finally there are those who question the assumption that factorizability is a locality condition Fine pp b Cartwright chaps and Chang and Cartwright Accordingly they deny that non factorizability implies non locality The main thrust of this line of reasoning is that the principle of the common cause is not generally valid Some notably Cartwright and Chang and Cartwright challenge the assumption that common causes always screen off the correlation between their effects and accordingly they question the idea that non factorizability implies non locality Others notably Fine deny that correlations must have causal explanation While these arguments challenge the view that the quantum realm as depicted by non factorizable models for the EPR B experiment must involve non locality they do not show that viable local non factorizable models of the EPR B experiment i e viable models which do not postulate any non locality are possible Indeed so far none of the attempts to construct local non factorisable models for EPR B experiments has been successful The question of the compatibility of quantum mechanics with the special theory of relativity is very difficult to resolve The question of the compatibility of quantum mechanics with the general theory of relativity is even more involved The answer to this question depends on the interpretation of special relativity and the nature of the exact constraints it imposes on influences between events A popular view has it that special relativity prohibits any superluminal influences whereas theories that violate factorizability seem to involve such influences Accordingly it is held that quantum mechanics is incompatible with relativity Another common view has it that special relativity prohibits only certain types of superluminal influence Many believe that relativity prohibits superluminal signaling of information Some also believe that this theory prohibits superluminal transport of matter energy and or action at a distance On the other hand there is the view that relativity per se prohibits only superluminal influences that are incompatible with the special relativistic space time the so called Minkowski space time and that this prohibition is compatible with certain types of superluminal influences and superluminal signaling for a comprehensive discussion of this issue see Maudlin section It is commonly agreed that relativity requires that the descriptions of physical reality i e the states of systems their properties dynamical laws etc in different coordinate systems should be compatible with each other In particular descriptions of the state of systems in different foliations of spacetime into parallel spacelike hyperplanes which correspond to different inertial reference frames are to be related to each other by the Lorentz transformations If this requirement is to reflect the structure of the Minkowski spacetime these transformations must hold at the level of individual processes and not only at the level of ensembles of processes i e at the statistical level or observed phenomena Indeed Bohm s theory which is manifestly non relativistic satisfies the requirement that the Lorentz transformations obtain at the level of the observed phenomena However satisfying the Lorentz transformations at the level of individual processes is not sufficient for compatibility with Minkowski spacetime for the Lorentz transformations may also be satisfied at the level of individual processes in theories that postulate a preferred inertial reference frame Bell Maudlin section suggests that a theory is genuinely relativistic both in spirit and letter if it can be formulated without ascribing to spacetime any more or different intrinsic structure than the relativistic metrics The question of the compatibility of relativity with quantum mechanics may be presented as follows Could a quantum theory that does not encounter the measurement problem be relativistic in that sense The main problem in reconciling collapse theories with special relativity is that it seems very difficult to make state collapse modeled as a real physical process compatible with the structure of the Minkowski spacetime In non relativistic quantum mechanics the earlier L measurement in the EPR B experiment induces a collapse of the entangled state of the particle pair and the L measurement apparatus Assuming for the sake of simplicity that measurement events occur instantaneously state collapse occurs along a single spacelike hyperplane that intersects the spacetime region of the L measurement event the hyperplane that represents the absolute time of the collapse But this type of collapse dynamics would involve a preferred foliation of spacetime in violation of the spirit if not the letter of the Minkowski spacetime The current dynamical collapse models are not genuinely relativistic and attempts to generalize them to the special relativistic domain have encountered difficulties see for example the entry on collapse theories Ghirardi Pearle and references therein A more recent attempt to address these difficulties due to Tumulka seems more promising In an attempt to reconcile state collapse with special relativity Fleming and Fleming and Bennett suggested radical hyperplane dependence In their theory state collapse occurs along an infinite number of spacelike hyperplanes that intersect the spacetime region of the measurements That is in the EPR B experiment a collapse occurs along all the hyperplanes of simultaneity that intersect the spacetime region of the L measurement Similarly a collapse occurs along all the hyperplanes of simultaneity that intersect the distant space like separated spacetime region of the R measurement Accordingly the hyperplane dependent theory does not pick out any reference frame as preferred and the dynamics of the quantum states of systems and their properties can be reconciled with the Minkowski spacetime Further since all the multiple collapses are supposed to be real Fleming p the predictions of orthodox quantum mechanics are reproduced in each reference frame The hyperplane dependent theory is genuinely relativistic But the theory does not offer any mechanism for state collapses and it does not explain how the multiple collapses are related to each other and how our experience is accounted for in light of this multiplicity Myrvold b argues that state collapses can be reconciled with Minkowski spacetime even without postulating multiple different collapses corresponding to different reference frames That is he argues with respect to the EPR B experiment that the collapses induced by the L and the R measurement are local events in the L and the R wing respectively and that the supposedly different collapses corresponding to different reference frames postulated by the hyperplane dependent theory are only different descriptions of the same local collapse events Focusing on the state of the particle pair the main idea is that the collapse event in the L wing is modeled by a one parameter family of operators the identity operator before the L measurement and a projection to the collapsed state after the L measurement and it is local in the sense that it is a projection on the Hilbert space of the L particle and similarly mutatis mutandis for the R particle Yet if the quantum state of the particle pair represents their complete state as the case is in the orthodox theory and the GRW Pearle collapse models these collapse events seem non local While the collapse in the L wing may be said to be local in the above technical sense it is by definition a change of local as well as distant spacelike properties The operator that models the collapse in the L wing transforms the entangled state of the particle pair a state in which the particles have no definite spins into a product of non entangled states in which both particles have definite spins and accordingly it causes a change of intrinsic properties in both the L and the R wing In any case Myrvold s proposal demonstrates that even if state collapses are not hyperplane dependent they need not be incompatible with relativity theory Recall section that in no collapse theories quantum mechanical states always evolve according to a unitary and linear equation of motion the Schr dinger equation in the non relativistic case and accordingly they never collapse Since the wave function has a covariant dynamics the question of the compatibility with relativity turns on the dynamics of the additional properties the so called hidden variables that no collapse theories typically postulate In Albert and Loewer s many minds theory see section the wave function has covariant dynamics and no additional physical properties are postulated Accordingly the theory is genuinely relativistic Yet as the compatibility with relativity is achieved at the cost of postulating that outcomes of measurements and typically any other perceived properties are mental rather than physical properties many find this way of reconciling quantum mechanics with relativity unsatisfactory Other Everett like interpretations attempt to reconcile quantum mechanics with the special theory of relativity without postulating such a controversial mind body dualism Similarly to the many minds interpretation of Albert and Loewer and contrary to Bohm s theory and modal interpretations on the face of it these interpretations do not postulate the existence of hidden variables But recalling section these Everett like interpretations face the challenge of making sense of our experience and the probabilities of outcomes and critics of these interpretations argue that this challenge cannot be met without adding some extra structure to the Everett interpretation see Albert and Loewer Albert pp Albert and Loewer Price pp and Barrett pp a structure that may render these interpretations incompatible with relativity Supporters of the Everett interpretation disagree Recently Deutsch Wallace a b and Greaves have suggested that Everettians can make sense of the quantum mechanical probabilities by appealing to decision theoretical considerations But this line of reasoning has been disputed see Barnum et al Lewis b Hemmo and Pitowsky and Price Modal interpretations constitute another class of no collapse interpretations of quantum mechanics that were developed to reconcile quantum mechanics with relativity and to solve the measurement problem Yet as the no go theorems by Dickson and Clifton Arntzenius and Myrvold demonstrate the earlier versions of the modal interpretation are not genuinely compatible with relativity theory Further Earman and Ruetsche argue that a quantum field version of the modal interpretation which is set in the context of relativistic quantum field theory like the one proposed by Clifton would be subject to serious challenges Berkovitz and Hemmo a b develop a relational modal interpretation that escapes all the above no go theorems and to that extent seems to provide better prospects for reconciling quantum mechanics with special relativity Recall section that many believe that parameter dependent theories i e theories that violate parameter independence are more difficult or even impossible to reconcile with relativity Recall also that one of the lines of argument for the impossibility of relativistic parameter dependent theories is that such theories would give rise to causal paradoxes In our discussion we focused on EPR B experiments in which the measurements are distant spacelike separated In a relativistic parameter dependent theory the setting of the nearby measurement apparatus in the EPR B experiment would influence the probability of the distant spacelike separated measurement outcome Sutherland argues that it is plausible to suppose that the realization of parameter dependence would be the same in EPR B experiments in which the measurements are not distant from each other i e when the measurements are timelike separated If so relativistic parameter dependent theories would involve backward causal influences But he argues in deterministic relativistic parameter dependent theories these influences would give rise to causal paradoxes i e inconsistent closed causal loops Furthermore Arntzenius argues that all relativistic parameter dependent theories are impossible on pain of causal paradoxes In his argument he considers the probabilities of measurement outcomes in a setup in which two EPR B experiments are causally connected to each other so that the L measurement outcome of the first EPR B experiment determines the setting of the L apparatus of the second EPR B experiment and the R measurement outcome of the second EPR B experiment determines the setting of the R apparatus of the first EPR B experiment And he argues that in this experiment relativistic parameter dependent theories deterministic or indeterministic would give rise to closed causal loops in which parameter dependence would be impossible Thus he concludes that relativistic parameter dependent theories are impossible Stairs anticipates the argument that the above experimental setup may give rise to causal paradoxes in relativistic parameter dependent theories but he stops short of arguing that such theories are impossible Berkovitz b section section argues that Arntzenius s line of reasoning fails because it is based on untenable assumptions about the nature of probabilities in closed causal loops assumptions that are very natural in linear causal situations where effects do not cause their causes but untenable in causal loops For an analysis of the nature of probabilities in causal loops see Berkovitz and section Thus he concludes that the consistency of relativistic parameter dependent theories cannot be excluded on the grounds of causal paradoxes He also argues that the real challenge for relativistic parameter dependent theories is concerned with their predictive power In the causal loops predicted by relativistic parameter dependent theories in Arntzenius s suggested experiment there is no known way to compute the frequency of events from the probabilities that the theories prescribe Accordingly such theories would fail to predict any definite statistics of measurement outcomes for that experiment This lack of predictability may also present some new opportunities Due to this unpredictability there may be an empirical way for arbitrating between these theories and quantum theories that do not predicate the existence such causal loops in Arntzenius s experiment Another attempt to demonstrate the impossibility of certain relativistic quantum theories on the grounds of causal paradoxes is advanced by Maudlin pp Maudlin does not present his argument in these terms but the argument is in effect based on such grounds Recall sections and that a way to try to reconcile quantum mechanics with relativity is to account for the curious correlations between distant systems by local backward influences rather than non local influences In particular one may postulate that the correlations between the distant measurement outcomes in the EPR B experiment are due to local influences from the measurement events backward to the state of the particle pair at the source In such models of the EPR B experiment influences on events are always confined to events that occur in their past or future light cones and no non locality is postulated Maudlin argues that theories that postulate such backward causation will be inconsistent More particularly he argues that a plausible reading of Cramer s transactional interpretation and any other theory that similarly attempts to account for the EPR B correlations by postulating causation from the measurement events backward to the source will be inconsistent Berkovitz section argues that Maudlin s argument is in effect that if such retro causal theories were true they would involve closed causal loops in which the probabilities of outcomes that these theories assign will certainly deviate from the statistics of these outcomes And similarly to Arntzenius s argument Maudlin s argument also rests on untenable assumptions about the nature of probabilities in causal loops for a further discussion of Maudlin s and Berkovitz s arguments and more generally the prospects of Cramer s theory see Kastner Furthermore Berkovitz sections and argues that similarly to relativistic parameter dependent theories the main challenge for theories that postulate retro causality is not causal paradoxes but rather the fact that their predictive power may be undermined That is the probabilities assigned by such theories may fail to predict the frequency of events in the loops they predicate In particular the local retro causal theories that Maudlin considers fail to assign any definite predictions for the frequency of measurement outcomes in certain experiments Yet some other theories that predicate the existence of causal loops such as Sutherland s local time symmetric Bohmian interpretation of quantum mechanics seem not to suffer from this problem Bell s Theorem intrinsic vs extrinsic properties physics holism and nonseparability quantum mechanics quantum mechanics Bohmian

Full report Highlights Charts and data Press release A large percentage of workers and firms operate in the informal economy outside the line of sight of governments in emerging market and developing economies This may hold back the recovery in these economies from the deep recessions caused by the COVID pandemic unless governments adopt a broad set of policies to address the challenges of widespread informality This study is the first comprehensive analysis of the extent of informality and its implications for a durable economic recovery and for long term development It finds that pervasive informality is associated with significantly weaker economic outcomes including lower government resources to combat recessions lower per capita incomes greater poverty less financial development and weaker investment and productivity PRAISE FOR THE BOOK By definition the informal economy is hard to study especially in developing countries This excellent book uses state of the art methodologies and recently available data to measure and analyze informality in advanced economies and emerging market and developing economies In particular it explores the business cycles in the informal sector in countries over the last years the study is the first one to show that cycles in the formal economy cause those in the informal economy Contrary to the widespread stereotype that the informal sector is a buffer that helps to mitigate recessions in the formal sector the informal sector s output moves in sync with the formal one and informal employment does not increase during recessions The book also produces the first analysis of the role of informality during the COVID pandemic Informal economic activity is concentrated in labor intensive service sectors and thus is especially vulnerable to social distancing and lockdowns A rigorous relevant and highly timely must read for development scholars and policy makers Sergei Guriev Professor of Economics Sciences Po and Former Chief Economist European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Significant data gaps have previously limited our ability to thoroughly study the informal economy until now The authors construct a novel and comprehensive dataset on informality which allows them to unpack the complexity of the informal sector and its interaction with the formal sector This timely book provides an invaluable knowledge resource for researchers and practitioners alike through an approach that balances rigorous quantitative and qualitative methods The resulting policy recommendations offer compelling pathways for policy makers looking to address some of the main obstacles to formalization of the economies and accelerate economic development in the post pandemic world Brahima Sangafowa Coulibaly Vice President Global Economy and Development The Brookings Institution This highly informative and timely book compiles various measures of the informal economy in a comprehensive global dataset Its analysis of informality s most important correlates provides important insights and policy implications written in highly accessible prose Franziska Ohnsorge and Shu Yu have edited an authoritative source of reference for everyone interested in the informal economy The questions raised in this book and the answers given make it essential reading for academics and policy makers alike Axel Dreher Professor of International and Development Politics Heidelberg University Germany Informal economic activity has long been recognized as an important phenomenon in developing economies one that poses a broad range of potentially serious policy challenges for both social and material wellbeing in those countries Yet for all the attention that various aspects of the informality phenomenon have received there is no single comprehensive treatment of the topic that simultaneously considers the challenges of measuring informality the identification of its causes in diverse settings its specific social and economic consequences and the range of context specific policy measures that can potentially be adopted to address those consequences Drawing on a comprehensive dataset covering a wide range of countries and time periods this book fills that gap I expect it to serve as a springboard for a more systematic and widespread integration of the problem of informality into development economics Peter Montiel Fairleigh S Dickinson Jr Professor of Economics Williams College The COVID crisis has exacerbated development challenges for many EMDEs including as a result of disproportionate impacts on informal economic activity and therefore women youth and lower skilled workers The Long Shadow of Informality provides important insights as to the extent impact and policy challenges posed by informality By deepening our understanding of a key constraint to development this book can help guide appropriately tailored and comprehensive policy responses required to avoid a great divergence in economic prospects both within and between countries Ceyla Pazarbasioglu Director of the Strategy Policy and Review Department International Monetary Fund By its very nature informality is hard to measure and even harder to address with policies This book provides the most comprehensive treatment to date combining different estimation methods covering every developing region in the world and spanning growth business cycles and sectoral issues Being wide ranging the book will elicit debate on various topics Thanks to this book those debates can be based on solid empirical foundations Shanta Devarajan Professor of the Practice of International Development Georgetown University PRESS RELEASE English Arabic Chinese French Japanese

In this article we provide a brief overview of the logic of action in philosophy linguistics computer science and artificial intelligence The logic of action is the formal study of action in which formal languages are the main tool of analysis The concept of action is of central interest to many disciplines the social sciences including economics the humanities including history and literature psychology linguistics law computer science artificial intelligence and probably others In philosophy it has been studied since the beginning because of its importance for epistemology and particularly ethics and since a few decades it is even studied for its own sake But it is in the logic of action that action is studied in the most abstract way The logic of action began in philosophy But it has also played a certain role in linguistics And currently it is of great importance in computer science and artificial intelligence For our purposes it is natural to separate the accounts of these developments Already St Anselm studied the concept of action in a way that must be classified as logical had he known symbolic logic he would certainly have made use of it Henry Walton In modern times the subject was introduced by among others Alan Ross Anderson Frederick B Fitch Stig Kanger and Georg Henrik von Wright Kanger s work was further developed by his students Ingmar P rn and Lars Lindahl The first clearly semantic account was given by Brian F Chellas For a more detailed account see Segerberg or the mini history in Belnap Today there are two rather different groups of theories that may be described as falling under the term logic of action One the result of the creation of Nuel Belnap and his many collaborators may be called stit theory a term that will be explained in the next paragraph The other is dynamic logic Both are connected with modal logic but in different ways Stit theory grew out of the philosophical tradition of modal logic Dynamic logic on the other hand was invented by computer scientists in order to analyse computer action only after the fact was it realized that it could be viewed as modal logic of a very general kind One important difference between the two is that for the most part actions are not directly studied in stit theory the ontology does not usually recognize a category of actions or events But dynamic logic does Among philosophers such ontological permissiveness has been unusual Hector Neri Casta eda with his distinction between propositions and practitions provides one notable exception The stit tradition is treated in this section the dynamic logic one in the next The term stit is an acronym based on sees to it that The idea is to add to an ordinary classical propositional language a new propositional operator stit interpreting stit i phi where i stands for an agent and phi for a proposition as i sees to it that phi The official notation of the Belnap school is more laborious i mathop mathsf stit phi Note that phi is allowed to contain nestings of the new operator In order to develop formal meaning conditions for the stit operator stit a semantics is defined A stit frame has four components a set T the nodes of which are called moments an irreflexive tree ordering lt of T a set of agents and a choice function C A maximal branch through the tree is called a history The tree T lt seems to correspond to a na ve picture familiar to us all a moment m is a temporary present the set left n n lt m right corresponds to the past of m which is unique while the set left n m lt n right corresponds to the open future of m each particular maximal linear subset of which corresponds to a particular possible future To formalize the notion of action begin with two general observations This is where the choice function C comes in for each moment m and agent i C yields a partitioning C i m of the set H m of all histories through m An equivalence class in C i m is called a choice cell Note that two histories belonging to the same choice cell agree up to the moment in question but not necessarily later on If h is a history running through m we write C i m h for the choice cell of which h is a member It is natural to associate C i m with the set of actions open to the agent i at m and to think of the choice cell C i m h as representing the action associated with h A stit model has an additional component a valuation A valuation in a frame it turns out is a function that assigns to a variable and each index either truth or falsity where an index is an ordered pair consisting of a history and a moment on that history The notion of truth or falsity of a formula with respect to an index can now be defined If V is the valuation we have the following basic truth condition for atomic phi The truth conditions for the Boolean connectives are as expected for example Let us write llbracket phi rrbracket m for the set left h in H m h m models phi right that is the set of histories agreeing with h at least up to m and such that phi is true with respect to the index consisting of that history and m Defining formal truth conditions for the stit operator there are at least two possibilities to be considered To distinguish the two different operators that those conditions define the former operator is called the Chellas stit written cstit while the latter operator is called the deliberative stit written dstit In words cstit i phi is true at an index h m if phi is true with respect to h and m for all histories h in the same choice cell at m as h this is called the positive condition The truth condition for dstit i phi is more exacting not only the positive condition has to be satisfied but also what is called the negative condition there must be some history through m such that phi fails to be true with respect to that history and m Both cstit and dstit are studied it is claimed that they capture important aspects of the concept sees to it that The two operators become interdefinable if one also introduces the concept it is historically necessary that Using Box for historical necessity define Then the formulas are true with respect to all indices One advantage of stit theory is that the stit analysis of individual action can be extended in natural ways to cover group action A number of the initial papers defining the stit tradition are collected in the volume Belnap One important later work is John F Horty s book The logic of stit was axiomatized by Ming Xu Michael Bratman s philosophical analysis of the notion of intention has had a significant influence on the development of the logic of action within computer science It will be discussed below In a series of papers Carlos Alchourr n Peter G rdenfors and David Makinson created what they called a logic of theory change later known as the AGM paradigm Two particular kinds of change inspired their work change due to deontic actions Alchourr n and change due to doxastic actions G rdenfors and before him Isaac Levi Examples of deontic actions are derogation and amendment laws can be annulled or amended while contraction and expansion are analogous doxastic actions beliefs can be given up new beliefs can be added Later the modal logic of such actions has been explored under the names dynamic deontic logic dynamic doxastic logic and dynamic epistemic logic For the classic paper on AGM see AGM For an introduction to dynamic deontic logic and dynamic doxastic logic see Lindstr m and Segerberg We will return to this topic in Section where it is viewed from the perspective of the field of artificial intelligence In linguistics there are two ways in which actions play a role on the one hand utterances are actions and on the other they can be used to talk about actions The first leads to the study of speech acts a branch of pragmatics the second to the study of the semantics of action reports hence is of a distinctly semantic nature In addition to this there is a special type of semantics dynamic semantics where meanings are not considered as state descriptions but as changes in the state of a hearer The study of speech acts goes back to Austin and Searle Both emphasise that using language is to perform certain acts Moreover there is not just one act but a whole gamut of them Austin himself puts the number in the magnitude of The classification he himself gives involves acts that are nowadays not considered as part of a separate science the mere act of uttering a word the phatic act or sentence is part of phonetics or phonology and only of marginal concern here By contrast the illocutionary and perlocutionary acts have been the subject of intense study An illocutionary act is the linguistic act performed by using that sentence it is inherently communicative in nature By contrast the perlocutionary act is an act that needs surrounding social contexts to be successful The act of naming a ship or christening a baby for example are perlocutionary The sentence I hereby pronounce you husband and wife has the effect of marrying two people only under certain well defined circumstances By definition perlocutionary acts take us outside the domain of language and communication Searle and Vanderveken develop a logic of speech acts which they call illocutionary logic This was refined in Vanderveken and Vanderveken Already Frege used in his Begriffsschrift the notation vdash phi where phi denotes a proposition and vdash the judgment sign So vdash phi says that phi is provable but other interpretations of vdash are possible accompanied by different notation for example models phi says that phi is true in the model dashv phi says that phi is refutable and so on An elementary speech act is of the form F phi where F denotes an illocutionary point and phi a proposition In turn an illocutionary force is identified by exactly seven elements There are exactly five points according to Searle and Vanderveken Later treatments of this matter tend to disregard much of the complexity of this earlier approach for the reason that it fails to have any predictive power Especially difficult to handle are strengths for example Modern models try to use update models instead see Section below Van der Sandt uses a discourse model with three different slates for each speaker and one common slate While each speaker is responsible for maintaining his own slate changes to the common slate can only be made through communication with each other Merin seeks to reduce the manipulations to a sequential combination of so called elementary social acts claim concession denial and retraction Uttering a sentence is acting This action can have various consequences partly intended partly not The fact that utterances as actions are embedded in a bigger scheme of interaction between humans has been put into focus recently see for example Clark Another important aspect that has been highlighted recently is the fact that by uttering a sentence we can change the knowledge state of an entire group of agents see Balbiani et al After publicly announcing phi phi becomes common knowledge among the entire group This idea sheds new light on a problem of Gricean pragmatics where certain speech acts can only be successful if certain facts are commonly known between speaker and hearer It is by means of an utterance that a speaker can establish this common knowledge in case it wasn t already there Davidson gave an account of action sentences in terms of what is now widely known as events The basic idea is that an action sentence has the form exists e cdots where e is a variable over acts For example Brutus violently stabbed Caesar is translated ignoring tense as exists e mathop mathrm stab e mathrm Brutus mathrm Caesar wedge mathop mathrm violent e This allows to capture the fact that this sentence logically entails that Brutus stabbed Caesar This idea has been widely adopted in linguistics moreover it is now assumed that basically all verbs denote events Parsons Thus action sentences are those that speak about special types of events called eventualities Vendler classified verbs into four groups Moens and Steedman add a fifth category The main dividing line is between states and the others The types b e all refer to change This division has been heavily influential in linguistic theory mostly however research concentrated on its relation to aspect It is to be noted for example that verbs of type c can be used with the progressive while verbs of type d cannot In an attempt to explain this Krifka and Krifka have introduced the notion of an incremental theme The idea is that any eventuality has an underlying activity whose progress can be measured using some underlying participant of the event If for example I write a letter then the progress is measured in amounts of words The letter is therefore the incremental theme in I write a letter since it defines the progress One implementation of the idea is the theory of aspect by Verkuyl Another way to implement the idea of change is constituted by a translation into propositional dynamic logic see Naumann Van Lambalgen and Hamm have applied the event calculus by Shanahan to the description of events The idea that propositions can not only be viewed as state descriptions but also as updates has been advocated independently by many people Consider the possible states of an agent to be in the simplest case a theory that is a deductively closed set of sentences Then the update of a theory T by a proposition phi is the deductive closure of T cup left phi right G rdenfors advocates this perspective with particular attention to belief revision Veltman develops the update view for the treatment of conditionals One advantage of the idea is that it is possible to show why the mini discourse It rains It may not be raining is infelicitous in contrast to It may not be raining It rains Given that an update is felicitous only to a consistent theory and that may phi with epistemic may simply means it is consistent written diamond phi the first is the sequence of updates with phi and diamond neg phi The second step leads to inconsistency since phi has already been added It is vital in this approach that the context is constantly changing Heim contains an attempt to make this idea fruitful for the treatment of presuppositions In Heim s proposal a sentence has the potential to change the context and this is why for example the sentence If John is married his wife will be happy does not presuppose that John is married Namely the second part of the conditional his wife will be happy is evaluated against the context incremented by the antecedent John is married This of course is the standard way conditions are evaluated in computer languages This parallel is exploited in Van Eijck see also Kracht The idea of going dynamic was further developed in Dynamic Predicate Logic DPL see Groenendijk and Stokhof where all expressions are interpreted dynamically The specific insight in this grammar is that existential quantifiers have a dynamically growing scope This has first been noted in Kamp where a semantics was given in terms of intermediate representations so called Discourse Representation Structures Groenendijk and Stokhof replace these structures by introducing a dynamics into the evaluation of a formula as proposed in Dynamic Logic DL An existential quantifier is translated as a random assignment x leftarrow of DL whose interpretation is a relation between assignments it is the set of pairs langle beta gamma rangle such that beta y gamma y for all y ne x in symbols beta sim x gamma The translation of the sentence A man walks is This is a proposition hence interpreted as a set One can however push the dynamicity even lower and make all meanings relational Then A man walks is interpreted by the program Here mathop mathrm man x uses the test constructor phi is the set of all langle beta beta rangle such that beta satisfies phi The meaning of the entire program therefore also is a relation between assignments Namely it is the set R of all pairs langle beta gamma rangle where beta sim x gamma and gamma x walks and is a man The meaning of by contrast is the set of all beta such that some langle beta gamma rangle in R Existential quantifiers thus have side effects the change in assignment is never undone by a quantifier over a different variable Hence the open endedness to the right of the existential This explains the absence of brackets in For an overview of dynamic semantics see Muskens et al The logic of action plays an important role in computer science This becomes evident once one realizes that computers perform actions in the form of executing program statements written down in some programming language changing computer internals and by interfaces to the outside world also that outside world As such a logic of action provides a means to reason about programs or more precisely the execution of programs and their effects This enables one to prove the correctness of programs In principle this is something very desirable if we could prove all our software correct we would know that they would function exactly the way we designed them This was already realized by pioneers of computer programming such as Turing and Von Neumann Goldstein and Von Neumann Of course this ideal is too hard to establish in daily practice for all software Verification is a nontrivial and time consuming occupation and there are also theoretical limitations to it However as the alternative is just massive testing of programs experimentally with no guarantee of correctness it has remained an active area of research to this day Program verification has a long history Already since the inception of the computer and its programming researchers started to think of ways of analyzing programs to be sure they did what they were supposed to do In the s the development of a true mathematical theory of program correctness began to take serious shape de Bakker Remarkably the work of John McCarthy who we will also encounter later on when we turn to the field of artificial intelligence played an important role here distinguishing and studying fundamental notions such as state McCarthy a This led on the one hand to the field of semantics of programming languages and on the other to major advances in program correctness by Floyd Naur Hoare and Dijkstra de Bakker Floyd and Naur used an elementary stepwise induction principle and predicates attached to program points to express invariant properties of imperative style programs Cousot programs that are built up from basic assignment statements of arithmetical expressions to program variables and may be composed by sequencing conditionals and repetitions While the Floyd Naur approach called the inductive assertion method giving rise to a systematic construction of verification conditions was a method to prove the correctness of programs by means of logic it was not a logic itself in the strict sense of the word The way to a proper logic of programs was paved by Hoare whose compositional proof method led to what is now known as Hoare logic By exploiting the syntactic structure of imperative style programs Hoare was able to turn the Floyd Naur method into a true logic with as assertions so called Hoare triples of the form left P right S left Q right where P and Q are first order formulas and S is a program statement in an imperative style programming language as mentioned above The intended reading is if P holds before execution of the statement S then Q holds upon termination of execution of S The issue whether the execution of S terminates can be put in the reading of this Hoare triple either conditionally partial correctness or nonconditionally total correctness giving rise to different logics see Harel et al To give an impression of Hoare style logics we give here some rules for a simple programming language consisting of variable assignments to arithmetic expressions and containing sequential conditional lif and repetitive lwhile composition Later Pratt and Harel generalized Hoare logic to dynamic logic Pratt Pratt a Harel Harel Kozen and Tiuryn Harel et al of which it was realized that it is in fact a form of modal logic by viewing the input output relation of a program S as an accessibility relation in the sense of Kripke style semantics A Hoare triple left P right S left Q right becomes in dynamic logic the following formula P rightarrow S Q where S is the modal box operator associated with the accessibility relation associated with the input output relation of program S The propositional version of Dynamic Logic PDL was introduced by Fischer and Ladner and became an important topic of research in itself The key axiom of PDL is the induction axiom where stands for the iteration operator S denoting an arbitrary finite number of iterations of program S The axiom expresses that if after any number of iterations of S the truth of P is preserved by the execution of S then if P is true at the current state it will also be true after any number of iterations of S A weaker form of PDL called HML with only an atomic action box and diamond and propositional connectives was introduced by Hennessy Milner to reason about concurrent processes and in particular analyze process equivalence Hennessy and Milner It is also worth mentioning here that the work of Dijkstra on weakest precondition calculus is very much related to dynamic logic and Hoare s logic In fact what Dijkstra calls the weakest liberal precondition denoted mathbf wlp S Q is the same as the box operator in dynamic logic mathbf wlp S Q S Q while his weakest precondition denoted mathbf wp S Q is the total correctness variant of this meaning that this expression also entails the termination of statement S Cousot It was later realized that the application of dynamic logic goes beyond program verification or reasoning about programs In fact it constitutes a logic of general action In Meyer a number of other applications of dynamic logic are given including deontic logic see also Meyer reasoning about database updates the semantics of reasoning systems such as reflective architectures As an aside we note here that the use of dynamic logic for deontic logic as proposed in Meyer needed an extension of the action language in particular the addition of the action negation operator The rather controversial nature of this operator triggered work on action negation in itself see e g Broersen Below we will also encounter the use of dynamic logic in artificial intelligence when specifying intelligent agents The logics thus far are adequate for reasoning about programs that are supposed to terminate and display a certain input output behavior However in the late seventies one came to realize that there are also programs that are not of this kind Reactive programs are designed to react to input streams that in theory may be infinite and thus show ideally nonterminating behavior Not so much input output behavior is relevant here but rather the behavior of programs over time Therefore Pnueli proposed a different way of reasoning about programs for this style of programming based on the idea of a logic of time viz linear time temporal logic Since reactivity often involves concurrent or parallel programming temporal logic is often associated with this style of programming However it should be noted that a line of research continued to extend the use of Hoare logic to concurrent programs Lamport Cousot de Roever et al Linear time temporal logic typically has temporal operators such as next time always in the future sometime in the future until and since An interesting difference between temporal logic on the one hand and dynamic logic and Hoare logic on the other is that the former is what in the literature is called an endogenous logic while the latter are so called exogenous logics A logic is exogenous if programs are explicit in the logical language while for endogenous logics this is not the case In an endogenous logic such as temporal logic the program is assumed to be fixed and is considered part of the structure over which the logic is interpreted Harel et al Exogenous logics are compositional and have the advantage of allowing analysis by structural induction Later Pratt b tried to blend temporal and dynamic logic into what he called process logic which is an exogenous logic for reasoning about temporal behavior At the moment the field of temporal logic as applied in computer science has developed into a complete subfield on its own including techniques and tools for semi automatic reasoning and model checking cf Emerson Also variants of the basic linear time models have been proposed for verification such as branching time temporal logic and in particular the logics CTL computation tree logic and its extension CTL Emerson in which one can reason explicitly about quantification over alternative paths in nondeterministic computations and more recently also an extension of CTL called alternating time temporal logic ATL with a modality expressing that a group of agents has a joint strategy to ensure its argument to reason about so called open systems These are systems the behavior of which depends also on the behavior of their environments see Alur et al Finally we mention still alternative logics to reason about programs viz fixpoint logics with as typical example the so called mu calculus dating back to Scott and de Bakker and further developed in Hitchcock and Park Park de Bakker and Meyer The basic operator is the least fixed point operator mu capturing iteration and recursion if phi X is a logical expression with a free relation variable X then the expression mu X phi X represents the least X such that phi X X if such an X exists A propositional version of the mu calculus called propositional or modal mu calculus comprising the propositional constructs rightarrow and false together with the atomic action modality a and mu operator is completely axiomatized by propositional modal logic plus the axiom phi X mu X phi rightarrow mu X phi where phi X Y stands for the expression phi in which X is substituted by Y and rule Kozen Bradfield and Stirling This logic is known to subsume PDL cf Harel et al In the field of artificial intelligence AI the aim is to devise intelligently behaving computer based artifacts with the purpose of understanding human intelligence or just making intelligent computer systems and programs In order to achieve this there is a tradition within AI to try and construct these systems based on symbolic representations of all relevant factors involved This tradition is called symbolic AI or good old fashioned AI GOFAI In this tradition the sub area of knowledge representation KR obviously is of major importance it played an important role since the inception of AI and has developed to a substantial field of its own One of the prominent areas in KR concerns the representation of actions performed by either the system to be devised itself or the actors in its environment Of course besides their pure representation also reasoning about actions is important since representation and reasoning with these representations are deemed to be closely connected within KR which is sometime also called KR R knowledge representation reasoning A related more recent development within AI is that of basing the construction of intelligent systems on the concept of an intelligent agent an autonomously acting entity regarding which by its very nature logics of action play a crucial role in obtaining a logical description and specification As said above the representation of actions and formalisms logics to reason with them are very central to AI and particularly the field of KR One of the main problems that one encounters in the literature on reasoning about actions in AI and much more so than in mainstream computer science is the discovery of the so called frame problem McCarthy and Hayes Although this problem has been generalized by philosophers such as Dennett to a general problem of relevance and salience of properties pertaining to action the heart of the problem is that in a common sense setting as one encounters in AI it is virtually impossible to specify all the effects by the actions of concern as well as notably all non effects For instance given an action think about what changes if the action is performed and what does not generally the latter is much more difficult to produce than the former leading to large complex attempts to specify the non effects But there is of course also the problem of relevance what aspects are relevant for the problem at hand which properties do we need to take into consideration In particular this also pertains to the preconditions of an action that would guarantee the successful performance execution of an action Again in a common sense environment these are formidable and one can always think of another pre condition that should be incorporated For instance for successfully starting the motor of a car there should be a charged battery sufficient fuel but also not too cold weather or even sufficient power in your fingers to be able to turn the starting key the presence of a motor in the car etc etc In AI one tries to find a solution for the frame problem having to do with the smallest possible specification Although this problem gave rise to so called defeasible or non monotonic solutions such as defaults normally a car has a motor which in itself gave rise to a whole new a realm within AI called nonmonotonic or commonsense reasoning this is beyond the scope of this entry we refer the interested reader to the article by Thomason in this encyclopedia We focus here on a solution that does not appeal to nonmonotonicity directly Reiter has proposed a partial solution within a framework called the situation calculus that has been very popular in KR especially in North America since it was proposed by John McCarthy one of the founding fathers of AI McCarthy b McCarthy The situation calculus is a dialect of first order logic with some mild second order features especially designed to reason about actions One of its distinctive features is that of the so called reification of semantic notions such as states or possible worlds as well as truth predicates into syntactic entities situations in the object language For the sake of conformity in this entry and reasons of space we will try rendering Reiter s idea within first order dynamic logic or rather a slight extension of it We need action variables to denote action expressions and equalities between action variables and actions or rather action expressions as well as universal quantification over action variables What is known as Reiter s solution to the frame problem assumes a so called closed system that is to say a system in which all relevant actions and changeable properties in this setting often called fluents to emphasize their changeability over time are known By this assumption it is possible to express the non change as a consequence of performing actions as well as the issue of the check for the preconditions to ensure successful performance in a very succinct and elegant manner and coin it in a so called successor state axiom of the form where A is an action variable and gamma f boldsymbol x A and gamma f boldsymbol x A are simple expressions without action modalities expressing the conditions for phi becoming true and false respectively So the formula is read informally as under certain preconditions pertaining to the action A at hand the fluent predicate f becomes true of arguments boldsymbol x if and only if either the condition gamma f boldsymbol x A holds or f boldsymbol x holds before the execution of A and the condition gamma f boldsymbol x A that would cause it to become false does not hold Furthermore the expression Poss A is used schematically in such axioms where the whole action theory should be complemented with so called precondition axioms of the form phi A rightarrow Poss A for concrete expressions phi A stating the actual preconditions needed for a successful execution of A To see how this works out in practice we consider a little example in a domain where we have a vase v which may be broken or not so we have broken as a fluent and actions drop and repair We also assume the non changeable predicates fragile and held in hand of an object Now the successor state axiom becomes and as precondition axioms we have textrm held in hand x rightarrow Poss mathop mathrm drop x and mathop mathrm broken x rightarrow Poss mathop mathrm repair x This action theory is very succinct one needs only one successor state axiom per fluent and one precondition axiom per action Finally in this subsection we must mention some other well known approaches to reasoning about action and change The event calculus Kowalski and Sergot Shanahan Shanahan and fluent calculus Thielscher are alternatives to the situation based representation of actions in the situation calculus The reader is also referred to Sandewall and Shoham for historical and methodological issues as well as the relation with non monotonic reasoning These ideas have led to very efficient planning systems e g TALplanner Kvarnstr m and Doherty and practical ways to program robotic agents e g the GOLOG family Reiter of languages based on the situation calculus and FLUX Thielscher based on the fluent calculus In the last two decades the notion of an intelligent agent has emerged as a unifying concept to discuss the theory and practice of artificial intelligence cf Russell and Norvig Nilsson In short agents are software entities that display forms of intelligence rationality and autonomy They are able to take initiative and make decisions to take action on their own without direct control of a human user In this subsection we will see how logic of action is used to describe specify the desired behavior of agents cf Wooldridge First we focus on single agents after which we turn to settings with multiple agents called multi agent systems MAS or even agent societies Interestingly the origin of the intelligent agent concept lies in philosophy First of all there is a direct link with practical reasoning in the classical philosophical tradition going back to Aristotle Here one is concerned with reasoning about action in a syllogistic manner such as the following example taken from Audi p Although this has the form of a deductive syllogism in the familiar Aristotelian tradition of theoretical reasoning on closer inspection it appears that this syllogism does not express a purely logical deduction The conclusion does not follow logically from the premises It rather constitutes a representation of a decision of the agent going to jog where this decision is based on mental attitudes of the agent viz his her beliefs jogging is exercise and his her desires or goals would that I exercise So practical reasoning is reasoning directed toward action the process of figuring out what to do as Wooldridge puts it The process of reasoning about what to do next on the basis of mental states such as beliefs and desires is called deliberation Dennett has put forward the notion of the intentional stance the strategy of interpreting the behaviour of an entity by treating it as if it were a rational agent that governed its choice of action by a consideration of its beliefs and desires As such it is an anthropomorphic instance of the so called design functionality stance contra the physical stance towards systems This stance has been proved to be extremely influential not only in cognitive science and biology ethology in connection with animal behavior but also as a starting point of thinking about artificial agents Finally and most importantly there is the work of the philosopher Michael Bratman which although in the first instance aimed at human agents lays the foundation of the BDI approach to artificial agents In particular Bratman makes a case for the incorporation of the notion of intention for describing agent behavior Intentions play the important role of selection of actions that are desired with a distinct commitment attached to the actions thus selected Unless there is a rationale for dropping a commitment such as the belief that an intention has been achieved already or the belief that it is impossible to achieve the agent should persist persevere in its commitment stick to it so to speak and try realizing it After Bratman s philosophy was published researchers tried to formalize this theory using logical means We mention here three well known approaches Cohen and Levesque tried to capture Bratman s theory in a linear time style temporal logic where they added primitive operators for belief and goal as well as some operators to cater for actions such as operators for expressing that an action is about to be performed lhappens alpha has just been performed ldone alpha and what agent is the actor of a primitive action lact i alpha agent i is the actor of alpha From this basic set up they build a framework in which ultimately the notion of intention is defined in terms of the other notions In fact they define two notions an intention to do and an intention to be First they define the notion of an achievement goal A Goal an A Goal is something that is a goal to hold later but is believed not to be true now Then they define a persistent goal P Goal a P Goal is an A Goal that is not dropped before it is believed to be achieved or believed to be impossible Then the intention to do an action is defined as the P Goal of having done the action in a way such that the agent was aware of it happening The intention to achieve a state satisfying phi is the P Goal of having done some action that has phi as a result where the agent was aware of something happening leading to phi such that what actually happened was not something that the agent explicitly had not as a goal Next there is Rao Georgeff s formalization of BDI agents using the branching time temporal logic CTL Rao and Georgeff Rao and Georgeff Wooldridge On top of CTL they introduce modal operators for Belief lbel Goal lgoal sometimes replaced by Desire ldes and Intention of the to be kind lintend as well as operators to talk about the success lsucceeded e and failure lfailed of elementary actions e So they do not try to define intention in terms of other notions but rather introduce intention as a separate operator of which the meaning is later constrained by reasonable axioms The formal semantics is based on Kripke models with accessibility relations between worlds for the belief goal and intention operators However possible worlds here are complete time trees modeling the various behaviors of the agent on which CTL formulas are interpreted in the usual way Next they propose a number of postulates axioms that they find reasonable interactions between the operators and constrain the models of the logic accordingly so that these axioms become validities For example they propose the formulas lgoal alpha rightarrow lbel alpha and lintend alpha rightarrow lgoal alpha for a certain class of formulas alpha of which alpha mathop mathbf E psi is a typical example Here mathop mathbf E stands for the existential path quantifier in CTL Rao and Georgeff also show that one can express commitment strategies in their logic For example the following expresses a single minded committed agent that keeps committed to its intention until it believes it has achieved it or thinks it is impossible which is very close to what we saw in the definition of intention in the approach of Cohen and Levesque where mathbf A stands for the universal path quantifier in CTL Finally there is the KARO approach by Van Linder et al Van der Hoek et al Meyer et al which takes dynamic logic as a basis instead of a temporal logic First a core is built consisting of the language of propositional dynamic logic augmented with modal operators for knowledge mathbf K belief mathbf B and desire mathbf D as well as an operator mathbf A that stands for ability to perform an action Next the language is extended mostly by abbreviations definitions in terms of the other operators to get a fully fledged BDI like logic The most prominent operators are The framework furthermore has special actions lcommit and luncommit to control the agent s commitments The semantics of these actions is such that the agent obviously can only commit to an action alpha if there is good reason for it viz that there is a possible intention of alpha with a known goal phi as result Furthermore the agent cannot uncommit to a certain action alpha that is part of the agent s commitments as long there is a good reason for it to be committed to alpha i e as long as there is some possible intention where alpha is involved This results in having the following validities in KARO Here mathbf I alpha phi denotes the possibly intend operator and mathbf Com alpha is an operator that expresses that the agent is committed to the action alpha which is similar to Cohen Levesque s intention to do operator lintend in Cohen and Levesque Informally these axioms say the following if the agent possibly intends an action for fulfilling a certain goal then it has the opportunity to commit to this action after which it is recorded on its agenda as long as an agent possibly intends an action it is not able to uncommit to it this reflects a form of persistence of commitments as long as there is a good reason for a plan on the agenda it will have to stay on if the agent is committed to an action it has the opportunity to uncommit to it but it may lack the ability to do this cf the previous axiom if an agent is committed to a sequence of two actions then it knows that it is committed to the first and it also knows that after performing the first action it will be committed to the second Besides this focus on motivational attitudes in the tradition of agent logics in BDI style the KARO framework also provides an extensive account of epistemic and doxastic attitudes This is worked out most completely in Van Linder et al This work hooks into a different strand of research in between artificial intelligence and philosophy viz Dynamic Epistemic Logic the roots of which lie in philosophy linguistics computer science and artificial intelligence Dynamic Epistemic Logic DEL is the logic of knowledge change it is not about one particular logical system but about a whole family of logics that allow us to specify static and dynamic aspects of knowledge and beliefs of agents cf Van Ditmarsch et al The field combines insights from philosophy about belief revision AGM style AGM as we have seen in Section dynamic semantics in linguistics and the philosophy of language as we have seen in Section reasoning about programs by using dynamic logic as we have seen in Section with ideas in artificial intelligence about how knowledge and actions influence each other Moore More generally we can see the influence of the logical analysis of information change as advocated by van Benthem and colleagues van Benthem van Benthem Faller et al Also Veltman s update semantics of default reasoning Veltman an important reasoning method in artificial intelligence Reiter Russell and Norvig can be viewed as being part of this paradigm For the purpose of this entry it is interesting to note that the general approach taken is to apply a logic of action viz dynamic logic to model information change This amounts to an approach in which the epistemic or doxastic updates are reified into the logic as actions that change the epistemic doxastic state of the agent So for example in Van Linder et al we encounter the actions such as lexpand phi lcontract phi lrevise phi referring to expanding contracting and revising respectively one s belief with the formula phi These can be reasoned about by putting them in dynamic logic boxes and diamonds so that basically extensions of dynamic logic are employed for reasoning about these updates It is further shown that these actions satisfy the AGM postulates so that this approach can be viewed as a modal counterpart of the AGM framework Very similar in spirit is the work of Segerberg on Dynamic Doxastic Logic DDL the modal logic of belief change In DDL modal operators of the form phi phi and phi are introduced with informal meanings after the agent has expanded revised contracted his beliefs by phi respectively Combined with the standard doxastic operator B where B phi is interpreted as phi is in the agent s belief set one can now express properties like phi B psi expressing that after having expanded its beliefs by phi the agent believes psi also cf Hendricks and Symons Finally in this subsection we mention recent work where the KARO formalism is used as a basis for describing also other aspects of cognitive behavior of agents going beyond BDI viz attitudes regarding emotions Meyer Steunebrink et al Steunebrink et al The upshot of this approach is that an expressive logic of action such as KARO can be fruitfully employed to describe how emotions such as joy gratification anger and remorse are triggered by certain informational and motivational attitudes such as certain beliefs and goals emotion elicitation and how once elicited the emotional state of an agent may influence its behavior and in particular its decisions about the next action to take Apart from logics to specify attitudes of single agents also work has been done to describe the attitudes of multi agent systems as wholes First we mention the work by Cohen Levesque in this direction Levesque et al Cohen and Levesque This work was a major influence on a multi agent version of KARO Aldewereld et al An important complication in a notion of joint goal involves that of persistence of the goal where in the single agent case the agent pursues its goal until it believes it has achieved it or believes it can never be achieved in the context of multiple agents the agent that realizes this has to inform the others of the team about it so that the group team as a whole will believe that this is the case and may drop the goal This is captured in the approaches mentioned above Related work but not a logic of action in the strict sense concerns the logical treatment of collective intentions Keplicz and Verbrugge It must also be mentioned here that inspired by several sources among which the work on knowledge and belief updates for individual agents as described by DEL and DDL combined with work on knowledge in groups of agents such as common knowledge see e g Meyer and Van der Hoek a whole new subfield has arisen which can be seen as the multi agent counter part of Dynamic Epistemic Logic This deals with matters such as the logic of public announcement and more generally actions that have effect on the knowledge of groups of agents This has generated quite some work by different authors such as Plaza Baltag Gerbrandy Van Ditmarsch and Kooi For example public announcement logic Plaza contains an operator of the form phi psi where both phi and psi are formulas of the logic expressing after announcement of phi it holds that psi This logic can be seen as a form of dynamic logic again where the semantic clause for phi psi reads in informal terms phi psi is true in a model state pair iff the truth of phi in that model state pair implies the truth of psi in a model state pair where the state is the same but the model is transformed to capture the information contained in phi Also in the other approaches the transformation of models induced by communicated information plays an important role notably in the approach by Baltag et al on action models Baltag Baltag and Moss A typical element in this approach is that in action model logic one has both epistemic and action models and that the update of an epistemic model by an epistemic action an action that affects the epistemic state of a group of agents is represented by a restricted modal product of that epistemic model and an action model associated with that action See Van Ditmarsch et al p this book is a recent comprehensive reference to the field Finally we mention logics that incorporate notions from game theory to reason about multi agent systems such as game logic coalition logic Pauly and alternating temporal logic ATL which we also encountered at the end of the section on mainstream computer science and its epistemic variant ATEL Van der Hoek and Wooldridge Van der Hoek et al For instance game logic is an extension of PDL to reason about so called determined player games Interestingly there is a connection between these logics and the stit approach we have encountered in philosophy For instance Broersen partially jointly with Herzig and Troquard has shown several connections such as embeddings of Coalition Logic and ATL in forms of stit logic Broersen et al a b and extensions of stit and ATL to cater for reasoning about interesting properties of multi agent systems Broersen This area currently is growing fast also aimed at the application of verifying multi agent systems cf Van der Hoek et al viz Dastani et al The latter constitutes still somewhat of a holy grail in agent technology On the one hand there are many logics to reason about both single and multiple agents while on the other hand multi agent systems are being built that need to be verified To this day there is still a gap between theory and practice Much work is being done to render logical means combining the agent logics discussed and the logical techniques from mainstream computer science for the verification of distributed systems from section but we are not there yet In this entry we have briefly reviewed the history of the logic of action in philosophy in linguistics in computer science and in artificial intelligence Although the ideas and techniques we have considered were developed in these separate communities in a quite independent way we feel that they are nevertheless very much related and by putting them together in this entry we hope we have contributed in a modest way to some cross fertilization between these communities regarding this interesting and important subject Please contact the author with suggestions events frame problem logic dynamic

molecular properties These can be used to evaluate the likelihood that a molecule will be stable in the stomach for pills that are swallowed and that it can travel through the blood stream cross the cell membrane and eventually be broken down and eliminated all without being too toxic to the body If these computational techniques were good enough there would be no need to do actual experiments But today s computer models cannot fully characterize a molecule s behavior in the body nor replace the intuition of a skilled pharmaceutical chemist Real molecules must still be tested in the laboratory to see how they react To save time and money on laboratory work experimental chemists use computational models to narrow the field of good drug candidates while also verifying that the candidates to be tested are not simple variations of each other s basic chemical structure Much of the work on drug identification actually takes place through collaboration between many research groups scattered around the world As part of this process experimental chemists send a list of compounds to the computational chemist who works on the data set and sends back the results Historically experimental chemists were forced to rely on computational chemists and other staff to run computer predictions Each prediction technique required running a separate program some commercial and others developed in house by different groups around the company and each program had its own set of inputs options configurations and failure behaviors An experimental chemist usually didn t have the training to work with them which meant that the computational chemists were forced to take time out of their work on developing new techniques to run routine models In AstraZeneca wanted to improve this process so that experimental chemists could make better computational predictions on their own and so that the research of the computational chemists could progress at a faster rate and make its way into the lab more quickly Pierre Bruneau a Principal Scientist at AstraZeneca had worked on this problem while at Zeneca which merged to form AstraZeneca He developed a web based interface called H X named after the allied navigation systems used during the second world war H X was based on an in house molecular property calculator called Drone This system used a Perl script which computed some of the simpler molecular properties by calling the appropriate prediction program usually through a wrapper written in Perl csh or a domain specific control language H X using Drone was a successful experiment and it was used by many people In AstraZeneca decided to develop it further and brought in Andrew Dalke as a consultant to improve the back end code by making it more robust extensible and maintainable Andrew a well known advocate for Python in computational chemistry and biology convinced the group that Python was the appropriate language for the next generation back end which was named PyDrone Python was chosen for this work because it is one of the best languages available for physical scientists that is for people who do not have a computer science background Many other powerful and expressive high level languages exist including Perl Lisp Scheme Ruby CAML and Haskell Of all these Python is one of the few that is based on research into usability and the factors that make a programming language easy to learn and use Yet Python was also designed to solve real world problems faced by an expert programmer The result is a language that scales well from small scripts written by a chemist to large packages written by a software developer The first iteration of PyDrone refactored the existing Perl code into more appropriate functions classes and modules while translating the code base into Python Refactoring the Perl code without moving to Python would have produced comparable architectural results but Python s explicit error handling and stronger type checking helped to considerably improve the code s robustness The current version of PyDrone uses about different external binaries and scripts to predict various molecular properties When an external program works correctly then the output is easy to parse into the desired results However these programs don t always work correctly are not fully documented and it s often hard to determine all the possible failure cases from the outside To compensate for this the PyDrone developers wrote tests to anticipate as many error cases as possible but it was impossible to rule out additional unexpected error cases after deployment From experience dealing with this issue first in Perl Drone and then in Python PyDrone we found that Python is better at catching many types of errors and at managing unexpected problems in a deployed application This is a result of the way in which the two languages approach error handling in general For example Perl s I O routines are quiet and failures must be checked explicitly usually with the or die idiom A conscientious programmer will always add those but they take up space are easy to forget and hard to test In contrast to this Python functions are noisy and almost always raise an exception automatically when there is a problem in code After rewriting in Python we initially thought this noisy behavior was a nuisance because Python kept raising exceptions and stopping where the old Perl code had kept on going However we soon found that nearly every exception indicated a previously undetected error case for which we needed to add new error handling code Python was helping us find problem spots and preventing us from letting silent errors into our data One example of an error case that Python uncovered for us was caused by an external prediction program that would usually return a numerical error code but in some cases was found to return the string error instead In Perl strings and numbers are converted automatically for example the string becomes the integer Unfortunately Perl also converts non numerical strings such as error to As a result of this Drone was treating error as a successful return value leading to incorrect results Python s stronger typing uncovered the error as soon as the rare case that caused it was executed Another way in which Python helped us to improve our code was by its inclusion of a complete stack traceback with each exception report We found this very useful in helping us understand the source of a problem without needing to run a debugger or add extra code instrumentation This feature of Python was particularly helpful in remote debugging of rare cases Andrew is in the United States and Pierre is in France When an error occurred Pierre s email with the traceback often contained enough information to pinpoint and fix the problem The next stage in PyDrone s development was to improve its extensibility Some molecular properties depend on other properties For example a molecule s mass depends on its composition The older Drone code maintained these dependencies manually with a set of if statements that specified which prediction routines should be called and in which order during execution of an analysis In this approach adding new dependencies soon led to a combinatorial nightmare To solve this problem in Python we developed a simple rule base which acts like a Python dictionary It contains a data cache and a mapping from property name to prediction function If a requested property name the dictionary key is in the cache we reuse it Otherwise we find the associated function call it to compute the value store the result in the cache and return it The functions themselves are given a reference to the Properties manager so they can recursively request any additionally needed dependencies To add a new prediction we register the new function in the function table and let the functions themselves handle the dependencies The cache is needed because some properties are expensive to compute or are needed by many other properties Architecture of the Property Manager Zoom in The resulting new architecture made a simple but profound difference to the project We now have a single system that can accommodate all current and future prediction methods that computes only the minimum needed to yield the requested results and that is easy to understand and maintain Before we built it in Python several people in the company had argued it impossible to build such a system at all The PyDrone architecture could have been implemented in many languages but Python s dynamic typing made it much easier to build our Property manager Some molecular properties are numbers others strings or lists and dictionaries and still others are class instances A statically typed language would have required extra hassle to allow a mixture of return types to be inserted into the Property manager Even Perl which is also dynamically typed would have required some way to distinguish between references to a scalar hash or list In Python it just worked and we could mix the data types of the keys in the Property manager dictionary without any extra effort at all Yet as described above Python does at the same time provide sufficient data type checking to find many kinds of common type mismatch errors One of the factors that made our Property manager so successful was that Python lets user defined types emulate the behavior of built in types Our Property manager acts very much like a lookup table that maps property name to value so we designed it to emulate a Python dictionary In Python this is done by implementing specific special methods such as getitem setitem and so forth By emulating a dictionary nearly every other Python function that operates on a dictionary would work with our manager It also made the code easier to understand and debug because the syntax and point of call usage fit naturally with what people expect Python facilitated our Property manager implementation in other ways as well One PyDrone feature that had been requested by users was the ability to describe a new prediction using an equation based on existing properties For example an equation might look like CLOGP HBA HB TOT MM HADCA MM QON VDW POL AREA where the variables are keys in the Property manager This was quite easy to implement in Python and we would be hard pressed to find a language that makes it any easier Python s mathematical expressions are almost identical to the standard form used in the sciences so we could use Python s eval statement to parse and evaluate the user defined expressions Because our Property manager acts like a Python dictionary it could at least in theory be provided directly to the eval statement as the locals dictionary used for variable lookup during expression evaluation As it turned out for performance reasons the eval implementation in Python accepts only built in dictionary types and not an emulated mapping type so we had to engage in some extra trickery to make our on demand dependency system work with equations Nevertheless the entire implementation was quite easy PyDrone took about months of development time another months of QA and weeks of documentation time to produce about lines of finished Python code Overall PyDrone has been a wonderful success for AstraZeneca As a result of using Python we were able to quickly and easily develop a great tool that is both very simple to use and that adapts well to new prediction methods The biggest problem we ve had with Python is that relatively few people at AstraZeneca use it for development The IT group prefers either Perl systems people or Java architecture people so we occasionally get requests to rewrite parts of the project in one of those languages Even so we have found developers are interested in learning Python especially when they see comparisons of development time and effort resulting

Thomas Paine was a pamphleteer controversialist and international revolutionary His Common Sense was a central text behind the call for American independence from Britain his Rights of Man was the most widely read pamphlet in the movement for reform in Britain in the s and for the opening decades of the nineteenth century he was active in the French Revolution and was a member of the French National Convention between and he is seen by many as a key figure in the emergence of claims for the state s responsibilities for welfare and educational provision and his Age of Reason provided a popular deist text that remained influential throughout the th century In his own lifetime and subsequently he has been extensively vilified and often dismissed Yet many of his ideas still command wide interest and enthusiasm in readers throughout the world Thomas Paine was born on January to a family of moderate means in Norfolk England His father was a Quaker and his mother an Anglican and it is likely Paine was baptized into the Anglican church He had some schooling although his father forbade him to learn Latin and at the age of twelve he was withdrawn from school and apprenticed to his father to learn the craft of staymaking When he was in his mid teens inspired by the romantic stories of naval life by one of his teachers Paine twice ran away from home to sea The first time he was intercepted The second time he enlisted on the privateer the King of Prussia The exact sequence of events over the subsequent ten to fifteen years is unclear He lived in London on and off but also had periods in Sandwich and in Margate He continued periodically to ply his skills as a staymaker he may have done some preaching in the Methodist persuasion and in he married a Mary Lambert who died the following year in childbirth Following his wife s death he sought his father in law s support to take up a career in the excise service He first served as an officer in December but in August he was dismissed Tradition has it that this was for stamping providing certificates for goods not inspected New research in Brent et al suggests it may have been for whistleblowing He wrote formally seeking re admission to the service which was granted While awaiting a posting he taught school in London In he accepted a posting to Lewes on the South Coast of England and he took up lodgings with a Samuel Ollive a local tobacconist In Lewes he became a member of the debating society the Headstrong Club and he was also reputed as a skater and player of bowls Ollive died in July and Paine took lodgings elsewhere But he sustained his links with the family and in March he married the daughter Elizabeth Ollive and established himself as part proprietor of the business The following year he went to London to press the claims of the excisemen for higher pay Although he returned to Lewes he was sacked by the excise and his marriage had failed and he sold up his business In the final settlement between Paine and his wife he was awarded He headed to London where he secured letters of introduction from Benjamin Franklin whom he had encountered on an earlier visit to the capital and embarked in April for the New World He was carried ashore in Philadelphia in November suffering from putrid fever but he survived In Philadelphia Paine developed an acquaintance with Robert Aitkin a publisher and bookseller who employed him to edit the Pennsylvania Magazine There remains considerable disagreement about which pieces in the Magazine were written by Paine but it seems clear that he did contribute and that he developed a reputation among political circles in Philadelphia as a result at just the time that tensions with Britain were reaching a crisis point In the autumn of encouraged by Benjamin Rush Paine began work on a pamphlet defending the case of American independence He discussed his work with Rush David Rittenhouse Benjamin Franklin and Samuel Adams but the work was his own save for the title for which Rush claimed responsibility Common Sense was the most widely read pamphlet of the American Revolution It was a clarion call for unity against the corrupt British court so as to realize America s providential role in providing an asylum for liberty Written in a direct and lively style it denounced the decaying despotisms of Europe and pilloried hereditary monarchy as an absurdity At a time when many still hoped for reconciliation with Britain Common Sense demonstrated to many the inevitability of separation Paine consolidated his reputation as a pamphleteer with his series of American Crisis letters he also served in a number of capacities for Congress and the Pennsylvanian Assembly Although he had links with the more radical elements of Pennsylvanian politics he also committed his energies to a number of more elite projects contributing to the establishment of the Bank of America to help raise money for the war and working with Robert Morris to encourage State Legislatures to accept the need for Federal taxation to support the war Following the conclusion of the war he was awarded a farm by the New York assembly and Congress voted him a grant of for his services After the Revolution he dedicated his time to scientific experiments designing an iron bridge capable of spanning wide distances without the use of piers experimenting with marsh gas with Washington and attempting to produce a smokeless candle with Franklin In he took a wooden model of his bridge to Paris and subsequently to England where an iron model of feet was forged and constructed for public display in a field near Paddington in May He also became increasingly caught up in the initial events of the French revolution thanks in part to his involvement with a group of French intellectuals enabled by Thomas Jefferson US Minister to France until late Paine contemplated writing a history of the French Revolution but he made slow progress exacerbated by his poor French When Edmund Burke s Reflections on the Revolution in France appeared in November he determined to answer it and turned his materials to that task The result Rights of Man February March coupled a narrative of French events with a trenchant attack on Burke and the Revolution Settlement of It was an immediate success and brought Paine into the circles of those seeking to achieve parliamentary reform in Britain He continued to visit France and was in Paris in June in the immediate aftermath of Louis XVI s flight to Varennes He collaborated with a small group including Nicholas Bonneville and the Marquis de Condorcet to produce a republican manifesto that was pasted on the walls of Paris to the outrage of most members of the National Assembly That movement was firmly repressed at the Massacre of the Champs de Mars in July by which time Paine was already back in Britain But the occasion marks a shift in his thinking from seeing monarchy as an inevitable part of the institutional order in the corrupt states of Europe to thinking that the American model could be applied more generally throughout Europe Where Rights of Man had shown considerable tolerance for France s limited monarchy his Rights of Man Part the Second March was explicitly republican and he drew extensively on his American experience in sketching the basic principles of a largely self regulating commercial society coupled with representative government the rule of law and a periodically renewable covenant The final chapter influenced by his friendship with Condorcet and other members of the Comit de Mendicit outlined a program for welfare provision for the poor aged disabled and destitute The two parts of Rights of Man were quickly combined in cheap editions at Paine s insistence and sold in unprecedented numbers Paine s advocacy of natural rights his attacks on mixed government his outspoken republicanism and his extensive proposals for schemes of social welfare set him apart from the more common opposition rhetoric that emphasized the need to protect the integrity of the mixed constitution to secure English liberties His success suggests that he was reaching a popular audience who attached diminishing weight to these traditions and were struck by his insistence on their essential equality and their right to challenge the status quo In May a prosecution for sedition was initiated against him When the case was heard in November of that year he was outlawed but by this time he had returned to France having been elected as a member to the National Convention in the summer of He arrived in Paris shortly before the September massacres and it seems clear that he found it hard to find his feet being out of sympathy with the more sanguinary elements in the city His closest connections were with Girondin leaders in Paris who were rapidly to fall from favour Moreover his plea in the National Convention for clemency for Louis XVI at his trial at the end of led to his denunciation by Marat and the enmity of the Jacobin faction He served with Condorcet and Sieyes on the Committee to design a republican constitution but the extent of his contribution is unclear and although Condorcet pressed on with the work producing a report in the spring of it was immediately shelved Paine led an increasingly constrained life as the Jacobins assumed ascendancy and his friends were arrested and executed fled or killed themselves Orders for his arrest were issued on December While he was being taken into custody he passed to his American friend Joel Barlow the manuscript for the first part of Age of Reason which was published shortly thereafter Paine spent eleven months in the Luxembourg not unconnected to the studied neglect of his case by the US Minister Gouvernor Morris and seems only narrowly to have escaped the guillotine When he left prison after Robespierre s execution it was thanks to the intervention of Morris s successor James Monroe On his release Paine was in an extremely debilitated state and Monroe looked after him in his home Paine s angry denunciation of Washington whom he believed had ignored his pleas for help and the publication of subsequent parts of Age of Reason made Monroe increasingly uncomfortable with his guest and Paine left to live with the printer Nicholas Bonneville and his family Although still a member of the National Convention Paine had rarely attended and did not do so after his release His one intervention was his Dissertation on First Principles of Government a critique of the Constitution of and a summary of his own thinking about politics in which he urged the Convention to institute universal manhood suffrage In responding to the attempted coup by Babeuf s conspiracy of equals Paine s Agrarian Justice developed further ideas fist canvassed in the second part of Rights of Man and set out a principled case for a tax on inheritance so as to provide a capital grant for all reaching the age of majority together with an annual pension for all at fifty arguing that the earth is common property to the human race and that everyone is owed compensation for the private appropriation of it Paine finally left France to return to America in during the Peace of Amiens but was vilified on his return for his radicalism his deism and for his embittered critique of Washington He was joined in America in by the wife of Nicholas de Bonneville and her three sons who lived with him for a period but this arrangement broke down and Paine became increasingly ill and isolated He died in obscurity in In William Cobbett the Tory turned radical and critic of Paine turned supporter had Paine s bones dug up and returned to England to be buried with honour They were promptly lost thereby ensuring that the man who declared his attachment to be to all the world not to any particular part retained his universal citizenship Paine s reputation has been a source of controversy since his own lifetime He was a controversialist what he wrote invariably provoked controversy and was intended to do so As such one needs a reasonably capacious understanding of philosophy to count him as a philosopher He was a pamphleteer a journalist a propagandist a polemicist Nonetheless he also settled on a number of basic principles that have subsequently become central to much liberal democratic culture Few of these are original to Paine but his drawing together of them and his bringing them before a wide popular audience at this key historical moment when the people emerge as a consistent and increasingly independent force on the political stages of Europe and North America has ensured that his works remain widely read and are seen as of enduring value That said a great deal about his life and about the value and interpretation of his work is hotley disputed and promises to remain so For example the intellectual and emotional legacy of Paine s experience in Britain is a matter of speculation in secondary work and has recently been strongly emphasised in Clark to the exclusion of other influences Other authors have emphasised American influence Cotler and still others that of his French experience Lounissi These debates also involve disputes over the character of English radicalism the impact of evolving American traditions of exceptionalism and internationalism and the question of how far Paine s thinking changes and develops over time and in response to particular political circumstances What should be emphasised is that these ongoing disagreements also involve conflicting interpretations of events ideas and actions This means that locating Paine and his ideas is also partly a question of arguing for a particular interpretation of the political debates events and controversies in which he was involved in America France and Britain And since these remain a matter of controversy in both academic and contemporary popular debate it is fair to say that Paine s thought and legacy remains deeply contested In Common Sense Paine opens his account with the contrast between society and government Society is produced by our wants and government by our wickedness the former promotes our happiness positively by uniting our affections the latter negatively by restraining our vices CW I CW refers to The Complete Writings of Thomas Paine P S Foner ed As with many Paine claims this seems simple intuitive and attractive Our interests unite us and it is only when we overstep the legitimate bounds of those interests or push them to the detriment of others that we need constraint But when we do that we ought to know better and as such Government can appropriately be regarded as constraining our vices What is less clear is how far we must assume vice and thereby government Society in every state is a blessing but government even in its best state is but a necessary evil in its worst state an intolerable one The opening of Common Sense can be read as a gloss on Locke s Second Treatise without the references to God Yet Paine claimed never to have read Locke He also seems clear in his first major pamphlet that government is a mode rendered necessary by the inability of moral virtue to govern the world CW I The issue then is how extensive must government be and what sort of government provides the necessary benefits without multiplying the evils Paine s view is that the more simple anything is the less liable it is to be disordered Simple government for Paine is republican government he rejects monarchical and mixed forms of government in favour of a system in which the liberty of choosing an House of Commons out of their own body is the key republican moment CW I Paine s attack on monarchy in Common Sense is essentially an attack on George III Whereas colonial resentments were originally directed primarily against the king s ministers and Parliament Paine lays the responsibility firmly at the king s door And he appeals to a sense among Americans that they have all the resources and every claim to rule themselves without the interference and control of a body half way around the world Subverting paternalist metaphors for Britain s colonial claims Paine creates an image of a nation come of age ready for freedom from its leading strings having every justification for separation from its unnatural parent and seeking to stand on its own as a commercial republic trading in its own right It is not America who is behaving unnaturally and ungratefully but the royal brute of Great Britain Nature has deserted the connection and art cannot supply her place CW I Americans do not see the way forward but it is simple The colonies need to be divided into districts districts should elect their representatives to Congress and Congress should choose a President by ballot from the delegates of each state in turn with the first state being chosen by lot To avoid injustice three fifths should be required for a majority To avoid imposing his views however he suggests that each state nominate two members to a Continental Congress to frame a charter fixing the details of the government always remembering that our strength is continental not provincial CW I And in a rare citation of another s works Paine appeals to Dragonetti s adage that the aim should be a mode of government that should combine the greatest sum of individual happiness with the least national expense CW I For all its success Common Sense is not without flaws It contains a digression on biblical accounts of the origin of monarchy its powerful rhetoric leaves unanswered a range of more practical and theoretical questions and the argument jumps around considerably Later editions added an appendix denouncing the Quakers for their quietism But its rhetorical effectiveness cannot be doubted which suggests that it intersected powerfully with the concerns and beliefs that were widespread in colonial America at the point of rupture Political theorists might want to press for more details about who will have the vote about whether there is an implicit acceptance of a doctrine of the fall about the extent to which his appeals to republics envisage a degree of republican civic virtue about whether the argument is based on an account of natural rights and so on But on such issues the pamphlet is either silent or only barely suggestive Unlike Locke this is not a principled justification for resistance so much as a concatenation of points about Americans taking their collective identity and independent interests seriously and separating from the increasingly arbitrary rule of Britain Given these sweeping claims it is easy to see why so many commentators have held that Paine was both lacking in intellectual sophistication and basically held to a consistent set of principles throughout his work since it is difficult to demonstrate that much he says is actively inconsistent with what he later wrote Nonetheless if we take increasing precision in his claims as evidence of greater attention to issues that he felt he could confidently sweep past in Common Sense then a case for a deepening of his thinking and for a process of change over time can be made While there may be suggestions of rights claims in Common Sense and in a number of minor texts attributed by some to Paine but where the authorship is a matter of dispute it is clear that the fully fledged account of rights that Paine advances in the first part of Rights of Man represents a significant development in his thinking It is common to attribute that development to the foil he found in Burke s Reflections on the Revolution in France where Burke inveighs against the idea that rights are preserved from the state of nature in the civil state Men cannot enjoy the rights of an uncivil and of a civil state together That he may secure some liberty he makes a surrender in trust of the whole of it CW VIII p And where he claims that in England We have not been drawn and trussed in order that we may be filled like stuffed birds in a museum with chaff and rage and paltry blurred shred of paper about the rights of man CW VIII p It seems more likely however that Paine s distinction between natural rights where we necessarily have the power to execute the right as in the right of conscience as against rights where we need the arm of society to secure the right as in property although more sharply expressed in Rights of Man is a product of discussions with Jefferson and French sympathizers with America in the late s when they were discussing the proposed Federal Constitution and its failure to contain a bill of rights In a letter to Jefferson written in Paine draws a distinction between rights they could individually exercise fully and perfectly and those they could not CW II In the reply to Burke this is used to show that every civil right grows out of a natural right or is a natural right exchanged that the civil power is made up of the aggregate of that class of the natural rights of man which becomes defective in the individual in point of power and that the power produced from the aggregate of natural rights imperfect in power in the individual cannot be applied to invade the natural rights which are retained by the individual CW I How much in fact separates Paine from Burke The rights in which our power is perfect are relatively few so that many of the things that really matter access to means of labour and sustenance freedom of movement and contract seem to fall under Burke s sense of matters of convenience which government orders on the basis of general utility Although Paine does not provide much detail it seems clear that he sees himself as different from Burke primarily because he argues for continuing normative salience of the natural right and for the on going collective sovereignty of the people over the arrangements that they make the better to secure those rights Paine s readers had little doubt that he sought to defend their rights from invasion but his distinction does not in itself do that After all what is to stop the collective encroaching on the rights of citizens One answer is given in Paine s account of popular sovereignty Common Sense might presume a principle of collective self determination and the sovereignty of the people but it does not articulate or defend it Something like this issue does come under consideration in Paine s Dissertations on Government a pamphlet written in defending the Bank of America and the principle that contracts formed by government ought to be respected by subsequent occupants of power Every government contains within itself a principle common to all which is that of a sovereign power or a power over which there is no control and which controls all others In republics such as those established in America the sovereign power remains where nature placed it in the people This sovereignty is exercised in electing and deputing a certain number of persons to represent and to act for the whole But he goes on to insist that As a result This position sits uncomfortably with more direct and active interpretations of the sovereignty of the people or any general will Hence Paine s claim in to be a Citizen of a country which knows no other Majesty than that of the People no other Government than that of the Representative body no other sovereignty than that of the Laws CW II Paine s account of sovereignty dramatically delimits collective power to the securing of civil rights based on natural right In Rights of Man he quotes Lafayette s claim that For a nation to be free it is sufficient that she wills it CW I Lafayette most likely meant it as a call to reject despotism but Paine s account is perhaps more subtle seeing it as a right of the nation to determine its government but also as a right that is itself delimited by the end of liberty that is by the protection of individual rights and by ensuring their more adequate security within the collective That this is so helps account for Paine s developing account of generational sovereignty In Rights of Man he attacks Burke s claim that the terms of the Revolution Settlement bind us meaning the people of the day our heirs and our posterity to them their heirs and posterity to the end of time CW I Paine demurs There never did there never will there never can exist a parliament or any description of men or any generation of men in any country possessed of the right or the power of binding and controlling posterity to the end of time Every generation must be as free to act for itself in all cases as the ages and generation which preceded it This looks as if it is a principle that Paine developed in tandem with or borrowed from Thomas Jefferson in when Jefferson first mentions it in his correspondence Recent work by Samuel Burry makes a powerful case for Paine drawing on a different reading of Smith s Wealth of Nations derived from his earlier work on the Bank and showing a strong independent streak The principle is a powerful one but it is negative no generation can be bound by those before it and none can bind those after But equally no generation is free to act unjustly In his Dissertations of Government Paine had struggled with precisely this issue in wanting to claim both the sovereign power of the people and the duty on the part of the state to respect contracts made previously by others in their capacity of representatives Paine tries to reconcile the claims by arguing that a contract is not a law but an action and while laws can be changed acts are binding He does not yet claim generational sovereignty although the right to change laws is clearly there But the insistence on a sovereignty of justice is designed to ensure that actions that involve the transfer of rights must have the protection of the state and cannot be justly abrogated What becomes clear is that as Paine struggles to articulate his account of rights he comes to defend a very Lockean account in which the government is there to interpret and to secure antecedently defined rights and just claims that are the outcome of the exercise of these rights Rights acquired through clear contract or agreement deserve every protection even if subsequent generations are at liberty to question the laws of the nation and to alter them as they will they are not at liberty to invade the property rights of people secured through past agreements Paine s institutional suggestions in Common Sense are hardly fully fledged proposals Indeed one of the most surprising aspects of Paine s writing is how little institutional discussion there is he is not a man for the detailed discussions of constitutions and legislative and executive arrangements Even his piece in the summer of Answer to Four Questions on the Legislative and Executive Power is not especially illuminating Most modern commentators tend not to notice this Paine is clearly a democrat he advocates democratic institutions and he rejects those of monarchy and aristocracy But such judgments are often deeply anachronistic If we examine what Paine actually says we see that his own perspective was one which evolved and remained inclusive in many areas It seems clear that Paine was a republican but in a changing and always very specific sense In Dissertations on Government he specifies it as government directed towards the public good or the good of the whole II In Rights of Man he understands it as government by election and representation I a definition of republic that matches closely that advocated by Madison in the Federalist Papers In Rights of Man he switches back to the earlier formulation Yet he steadfastly refuses to call the form of government he is interested in a democracy which he identifies with ancient direct democracy and sees as essentially limited The system he sees as operating in America is representation ingrafted upon democracy CW I And unlike Joel Barlow he does not use the neologism representative democracy nor like John Adams representative government Paine thus plays a part in the process of transforming representation from something that was seen as compatible with monarchical indeed with absolutist states although it could also take more popular forms often linked to a gothic feudal past into something that was directly linked to the sovereignty of the people in their nations But in many respects he does little especially innovative The one major impact of his work was to bring to a wide audience some of the thinking that he shared with both Madison and Jefferson about the distinctive features of the American form of government Rights of Man is a rather mixed performance combining historical narrative of events in France engagement with Burke the adumbration of principles and some powerful moments of political rhetoric suggesting that Burke has constructed a set of tragic paintings by which he has outraged his own imagination CW I that Burke pities the plumage but forgets the dying bird CW I and that he has worked up a tale accommodated to his own passions and prejudices He makes his points about rights polemically as he does those concerning the sovereignty of each generation and in drawing a distinction between the constitution and the government and his most passionate attacks are on the hereditary principle and its accompanying gibberish of titles and distinctions the idea of hereditary legislators is as inconsistent as that of hereditary judges or hereditary juries and as absurd as an hereditary mathematician or an hereditary wise man and as ridiculous as an hereditary poet laureate CW I In Rights of Man Paine shifts the ground substantially He hardly mentions events in France and barely touches on Burke Instead the revolution in America is announced as an event of global importance the place where the principles of universal reformation could begin CW I What began in America is now seen not as an exception but as the trigger for a renovation or the world as a whole The relative tolerance for France s monarchy in the first part of Rights of Man is set aside suggesting that Paine had not previously thought that the old world states could manage a representative system of the American form but that he now does think this Moreover his old distinction between society and government is re animated but instead of emphasizing the inevitability of vice he represents society as in almost every respect sufficient unto itself Government is no further necessary than to supply the few cases to which society and civilisation a new concept are not conveniently competent CW I Indeed the more perfect civilisation is the less occasion has it for government because the more does it regulate its own affairs and govern itself CW I And again it is America that is the model where the country subsisted with hardly any form of government throughout the revolution and the subsequent period Moreover America becomes the model for reform a society that agrees articles establishes a constitution and is able periodically to revise the constitution as the collective act of the people Contrasting old forms of government based on an assumption of power for the aggrandizement of itself and the new a delegation of power for the common benefit of the people CW I Paine roots the new forms in the establishment of a constitution and the regulation of government in accordance with the constitution for the good of all seeing the American example as one that may be spread throughout the globe Indeed Paine thinks it is too soon to determine to what extent of improvement government may yet be carried For what we can foresee Europe may form but one great republic and man be free of the whole CW I This is a hymn to representative government to minimal government and to government with the primary concern of protecting the natural rights of man more effectively It is not a defense of democracy or universal suffrage For all his characterization as a democrat he does not embrace that description and there is no advocacy of universal suffrage prior to Paine s Letter Addressed to the Addressers written and published in the summer of shortly before he left for France This should further alert us to the fact that in this period Paine s thinking was changing often as rapidly as events around him changed In the final chapter of Rights of Man Paine addresses the expenditure of the British state and to issues of commerce Since his Letter to the Abbe Raynal he had expressed a growing confidence in commerce as a means of uniting the interests of nations and rendering outdated and irrelevant the European system of war The final chapter of Rights of Man develops the same view suggesting the incompatibility between monarchical regimes and the growth of commerce and national wealth and going on to itemize the taxation raised in Britain to support the costs of monarchical wars Given the new era of peace between nations consequent upon the revolutions in America and France Paine raises the question of what should be done about the immense sums raised in taxes in Britain some millions suggesting that whoever has observed the manner in which trade and taxes twist themselves together must be sensible of the impossibility of separating them suddenly CW I Paine then develops a series of welfare proposals that seem to have no underlying principle of justice but are proffered wholly as a way of redirecting spending He advocates that poor relief be removed as a local tax and replaced by central provision from government coffers that pensions be offered for those advanced in age starting at and in full form at that provision be made for the education of the poor that maternity be benefit be granted to all women immediately after the birth of a child that a fund be established for the burial of those who die away from home and that arrangements be made for the many young people who travel to the metropolis in search of a livelihood to provide initial accommodation and support until they find work Paine ends by identifying provision for those who have served in the army and navy and suggesting that as demands on the public purse from these sources declines then items of indirect taxation might also be lifted and the burden of taxation gradually shifted towards a progressive taxation on landed property coupled with the abolition of primogeniture and a progressive tax on the income from investments Although certainly influenced by his acquaintance with Condorcet and members of the Comit de Mendicit de la Constituante this raft of proposals represents a major innovation on Paine s part its slight oddity being the absence of any clear set of underlying principles for its justification The ad hoc turn to welfare in the second part of Rights of Man finds some compensation in the short pamphlet Agrarian Justice that Paine wrote after his release from prison in response to the unrest in in Paris as protests spread against the economic hardship suffered in the capital stimulating culminating in Babeuf s conspiracy of equals Unlike the final chapter of Rights of Man Agrarian Justice provides a principled defense for welfare provision rooted in a conception of the original equality of man and the equal right to a subsistence from the earth He acknowledges that there are benefits to allowing private property in land and its cultivation but argues that every proprietor owes the community a ground rent for the land he holds which should be used as a right of inheritance for all paying the sum of as a compensation for the loss of natural inheritance at the age of twenty one and an annual grant to the aged These payments are a matter of right not of charity A claim against the common stock that all may make on the ground that no person ought to be in a worse condition when born under what is called a state of civilization than he would have been had he been born in a state of nature I The money is to be raised from progressive taxation in inherited wealth and will contribute to its more equal distribution To modern critics it may seem odd to couple the essentially libertarian sentiments of the opening of the second part of Rights of Man with a major raft of welfare reforms But Paine clearly did not think about these reforms as an extension of government Although he does not make the point they seem to be more a matter of administration and that is in keeping with his essentially consensual view of the formal exercise of responsibilities by those invested with the confidence of the nation as a whole Paine s proposals probably had little practical effect on the emergence of the welfare state but they helped influence early socialist doctrines and working men s associations and they have since been taken up by those advocating a right to basic income or a child inheritance as a way of ensuring that the young need not inherit their parents poverty See Van Parijs and Vanderborght In his Letter Addressed to the Addressers and more fully in Dissertation on First Principles of Government Paine commits to the conclusion that equal rights entail an equal right to have a say in one s representative He provides two main arguments In the Letter he argues that as every man over the age of twenty one pays taxes in one form of another so everyone has a right to vote or a form of entitlement through contribution But in the Dissertation he makes the case wholly on the basis of equal natural rights the right of voting for representatives is the primary right by which other rights are protected To take away this right is to reduce a man to slavery for slavery consists in being subject to the will of another and he that has not a vote in the election of representatives is in this case II It is possible to exclude men from the right of voting but it impossible to exclude them from the right of rebelling against that exclusion and when other rights are taken away the right of rebellion is made perfect II This suggests that the role of rights grows in importance for Paine making little appearance at all before and then coming to play an expanding role in his account to provide the underpinning for political authority and an account of its limits to justify the right to vote and to make the case for a right to land and the fruits of nature which is translated into an inheritance right and a range of welfare rights In his account of the origin of rights in Rights of Man he suggests that those like Burke who appeal to the authority of antiquity simply do not go back far enough For a man so frequently called an atheist Paine shows a remarkable confidence in the divine order of the creation The work that did most to damage his reputation in America and which split his supporters in Britain was his Age of Reason which was followed by a further part in and additional writings compiled by later editors into a third part from The Age of Reason is not an atheist tract but a deist one It combines scathing criticism of claims to authority for the bible by religious authorities with an expression of confidence in a divinely ordered world revealed in nature through the exercise of reason that drew heavily on the lectures he had attended in London prior to leaving for America given by James Ferguson and Benjamin Martin Indeed he seemed to have committed their account to memory and uses the text to lay out the order of the universe to speculate on the possibility of a plurality of worlds and to dismiss all claims for mystery miracles and prophecy God is an unmoved first cause who designs and sets the universe in motion for the benefit of man and the moral duty of man consists in imitating the moral goodness and beneficence of God manifested in the creation toward all His creatures everything of persecution and revenge between man and man and everything off cruelty to animals is a violation of moral duty I Although the later parts of Age of Reason descend into detailed interpretation and controversy and lose much of their intuitive appeal the first part is a powerful confession of rationalist faith in a divine creator whose design can be appreciated by man in the Bible of Creation whose principles are eternal and which rejects as meaningless the claims to authority and the theology of the Christian Churches The study of theology as it stands in the Christian churches is the study of nothing it is founded on nothing it rests on no principles it produces no authorities it has no data it can demonstrate nothing and it admits of no conclusion CW I The only religion that has not been invented and that has in it every evidence of divine originality is pure and simple Deism CW I And as simple government avoids us becoming the dupes of fraud so simple belief protects us from the fraud of priestcraft which so often runs hand in hand with despotism Paine s religious views not unlike his political views are not especially original or subtle They follow much of the deist writing of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries But as with much Paine wrote the bluntness and sweeping rhetoric that alienates the more philosophically inclined modern reader were an essential element in his success and his continuing importance Paine spoke to ordinary people and they read him in their thousands indeed he was often read aloud in public houses and coffee shops He claimed no authority over them but helped them to doubt those who did claim such authority whether civil or religious and he affirmed over and over again their right and responsibility to think for themselves and to reach their own judgment on matters He did so at a time when the press had become capable of reaching even the poorest of society when the Attorney General launched the prosecution of Rights of Man he distinguished between the first part which was ushered into the world under circumstances that led me to conceive that it would be confined to the judicious reader and the second part which with an industry incredible it was either totally or partially thrust into the hands of all persons in this country of subjects of every description Gentlemen to whom are those positions that are contained in this book addressed to the ignorant to the credulous to the desperate State Trails v Paine would have embraced the description although he was less of a common man than many who have subsequently eulogized him make him out to be In many respects he was a moderately respectable radical with a deep suspicion of the hierarchical systems of Europe a brimming confidence in his own judgment that his experience in America confirmed which expressed itself in his willingness to tackle a range of subject areas including bridge building and scientific experiments and with a growing sense that he knew how to communicate with powerful effect with a popular audience at exactly the point at which that popular audience was beginning to feel and test its political influence Paine was vehemently attacked in his own lifetime if the scurrilous biography was not invented for him it certainly attained something of an art form in his depiction He was outlawed in England nearly lost his life in France and was largely ostracized and excluded when he returned to America A sizable collection of papers at his New Rochelle farm were destroyed in a fire and his oeuvre remains contested at least at the margins Biographers have drawn heavily on early work by Moncure Conway but while several new accounts appear each decade few add much to our knowledge Serious analysis of his ideas is relatively rare and tends to be more historically than philosophically orientated However recent work has begun to give his ideas more serious philosophical attention such as that by van Parijs on basic income Anderson on social insurance and Lamb Burry and Warren on intergenerational justice and rights and is helping readers to recognizes his importance Until very recently he was on the edges of the canon of political thought easily dismissed by those who wanted more substantial philosophical fare and subject to fits of enthusiasm by writers who were either insufficiently attuned to the complexities of the period or were simply uncritical Such attitudes do poor service to the history to the ideas or to the man The developing philosophical interest is very much to be welcomed civil rights common good deism democracy property and ownership representation political republicanism rights social minimum basic income sovereignty Copyright by Mark

th century British aesthetics addressed itself to a variety of questions What is taste What is beauty Is there is a standard of taste and of beauty What is the relation between the beauty of nature and that of artistic representation What is the relation between one fine art and another How ought the fine arts be ranked one against another What is the nature of the sublime and ought it be ranked with the beautiful What is the nature of genius and what is its relation to taste Although none of these questions was peripheral to th century British aesthetics not all were equally central The question on which the others tended to turn was the question concerning the nature of taste But this question was not simply how best generally to define taste Everyone seems to have been in at least rough agreement with Joseph Addison s early definition of taste as that faculty of soul which discerns the beauties of an author with pleasure and the imperfections with dislike Addison and Steele no But agreeing with Addison meant agreeing only to use taste to refer to that faculty and to acknowledge that such discerning has something of the phenomenology of sensation The central question was how to think of taste so defined Is taste a higher cognitive faculty akin perhaps to reason with objects of a primarily intellectual nature Or is it a lower bodily faculty more akin to the five bodily senses and with objects of a primarily material nature The major theories that arose in response to this question can be grouped into three main lineages a internal sense theories of which the theories of Shaftesbury Hutcheson Hume and and Reid are representative b imagination theories of which theories of Addison and Burke are representative and c association theories of which the theories of Gerard and Alison are representative Shaftesbury takes up aesthetic questions from time to time across his Characteristics of Men Manners Opinions Times first published in particularly within its third fourth and fifth Treatises But it is perhaps only within this last treatise the dialogue The Moralists a Philosophical Rhapsody that he can be said to develop a theory of taste Near the beginning of the dialogue s climactic section Section II of Book III Shaftesbury s spokesman Theocles issues a pair of imperatives one ought never to admire the Representative Beauty except for the sake of the Original nor aim at other Enjoyment than of the rational kind Cooper It is largely in the subsequent explication of these imperatives that Shaftesbury s highly influential theory of taste emerges Shaftesbury does not intend the force of these imperatives to be negative merely He clearly thinks that one ought to admire the original beauty referred to in the first imperative indeed he later identifies it with the beauty of the divine mind Moreover the admiration of beauty referred to in the first imperative just is the enjoyment of the rational kind referred to in the second Hence the two imperatives reversing their order might be paraphrased as follows one ought to seek the enjoyment of beauty as opposed to the rival enjoyments that one might mistake for the enjoyment of beauty and the enjoyment of beauty that one ought to seek ought always to be for the sake of the original as opposed to the sake of the representative merely To say that the rival enjoyments that one might take for the enjoyment of beauty are not of the rational kind is to say that they are merely sensory or bodily in nature Such non rational enjoyments moreover are interested in the sense that they depend on the thought of and beget a desire for the use or possession of their objects Theocles illustrates this point with a series of examples culminating in that of sexual pleasure taken at the sight of a human body I was apprehensive says his interlocutor Philocles that An example surfacing a bit later serves both to reinforce the distinction between such non rational enjoyments and the rational enjoyment of beauty and to introduce the distinction between the admiration of representative beauty for its own sake and that for the sake of the original Enjoyment taken in the sight of a coin is enjoyment taken in its beauty only if it arises not from any thought of what the coin may buy but merely from the contemplation of the design or form of the coin s inscription Whether in addition this is admiration of the coin s representative beauty for the sake of the original depends on whether one recognizes the representative nature of the coin s beauty Because the coin is beautiful in virtue of its design or form it is beautiful not in virtue of its material properties but in virtue of the effect that some mind has had upon it But if the coin is beautiful in virtue of the effect of some mind upon it this can only be because that mind is itself beautiful the beauty of the coin being representative merely of the original beauty of that mind Hence to admire the beauty of the coin or the beauty of any material object without acknowledging that its beauty merely shadows the beauty of the mind that designed it is to fail to admire representative beauty for the sake of the original Cooper But there is a complication If the mind that formed the coin is a human mind then while its beauty is original relative to the coin it is representative relative to the beauty of the mind that formed it Hence there are Three Degrees or Orders of Beauty Hence all beauty ultimately resolves it self Cooper into the beauty of the divine mind Thus admiring the representative beauty of the coin for the sake of the original requires tracing its beauty not merely to the mind that designed it but also to the mind that designed that mind A consequence of the view that the divine mind is the source of all beauty is that beauty is not relative to human nature merely but is absolute and real Indeed given Shaftesbury s pantheistic leanings things turn out on his view to be beautiful quite literally from the point of view of the universe A further consequence is that beauty inhering only in mind or in its reflection cannot be grasped by any bodily sense but only by the mind itself But Shaftesbury does not rest with the claim that it is the mind that grasps beauty he adds the claim that it is by a mental or inward sense that the mind does so Though it is difficult to know just what Shaftesbury takes this claim to come to the general idea is that the faculty by which the mind discerns beauty has enough in common with external sense to warrant the term sense and to be regarded as no less natural or basic than external sense In The Moralists he observes that the discernment of beauty has the immediacy of external sensation and so must be regarded as natural as external sensation No sooner is an object of the right kind placed before the mind And in a famous passage from An Inquiry concerning Virtue and Merit Treatise IV Shaftesbury observes that the discernment of beauty has the necessity or will independence of external sensation and so again must be regarded as natural on a par with external sensation Once an object of the right kind is placed before the mind a verdict as to its beauty cannot be withheld Shaftesbury it bears mentioning did not originate the idea that it is by an inward sense that we lay hold of the sublime and the beautiful That idea is an element of the neoplatonic tradition which Shaftesbury s work extends and can be traced back to St Augustine De vera religione and Plotinus if not to Plato himself a d On the title page of the first edition of his An Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue Francis Hutcheson acknowledges a deep debt to Shaftesbury announcing that The Principles of the late Earl of Shaftsbury would be explained and defended therein But it is open to question whether Hutcheson overstates his debt The debt is deepest with regard to the notion of internal sense but Hutcheson can fairly be said to make this notion his own That is certainly the judgment of history anyone undertaking to explain defend or refute the notion of internal sense after took himself to be explaining defending or refuting the principles of Dr Hutcheson Hutcheson gives one argument for the sensibility and another for the internality of the power by which we discern beauty His argument for its sensibility is largely a systematization and amplification of Shaftesbury s That the discernment of beauty is sensible follows from the immediacy necessity and disinterestedness of the arising of the pleasure by which beauty is discerned It is in arguing for the internality of the power of discerning beauty that Hutcheson s departure from Shaftesbury begins to show Shaftesbury it will be recalled argues that the discernment of beauty is internal or mental on the grounds that the objects of beauty necessarily are mind alone can discern beauty because mind alone is beautiful external objects managing a degree of beauty only by having a bit of mind imprinted on them But Hutcheson cannot make this argument because he does not think that objects of beauty are necessarily internal Hutcheson does follow Shaftesbury in maintaining that things are beautiful in virtue of their proportion or order Hutcheson s preferred and more precise term is uniformity amidst variety and he may follow Shaftesbury in thinking all proportion or order to be the effect of mind But he importantly does not follow Shaftesbury in inferring from the premise that things are beautiful owing to the effect of mind to the conclusion that mind alone is beautiful Hutcheson begins his argument for the internality of the power of discerning beauty by observing that the five external senses are insufficient for that discernment one could have all five in perfect working order and yet be insensible to beauty Hutcheson This observation however does not seem to show the discernment of beauty to be internal It seems to show merely that such discernment cannot be identified with any known external power But Hutcheson continues Here the reasoning is that the power of discerning beauty must be internal because some objects of beauty are But given that Hutcheson concedes that many objects of beauty are not internal the proper conclusion seems to be that the power of discerning beauty is neither exclusively internal nor exclusively external In any case the power of discerning beauty cannot be internal after Shaftesbury s manner But after what manner is it internal then Hutcheson simply never says in An Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue though he wastes no time supplying this deficiency in the immediately subsequent An Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions and Affections first published in An internal sense he there clarifies is one whose ideas arise only if certain other ideas have already arisen Sight is not an internal sense since the arising of the idea of blue for example does not depend upon the previous arising of any other idea But the sense of beauty is internal because the arising of the pleasurable idea of beauty depends upon the previous Reception and Comparison of various sensible Perceptions or intellectual ideas when we find Uniformity among them Hutcheson Another way of putting the point is to say that internal senses depend for their objects on the operation of other powers while external senses do not Hence in point of internality internal senses are apparently on a par with the powers of reason and memory for example unless some other power or powers has operated to place an object before the mind there is nothing about which to reason nothing to remember and nothing internally to sense This use of internal and external may be thought misleading given that it allows both external and internal powers to operate on objects both bodily and intellectual both from within and from without Hutcheson came to agree with this criticism apparently In later works he replaces internal with reflex or subsequent to refer to powers that depend on others for their objects and external with direct or antecedent to refer to powers that do not Hutcheson and This transformation of Shaftesbury s notion of an internal sense is not the only consequence of Hutcheson s rejection of the view that mind alone is beautiful It will be recalled that it is this view or more particularly the view that all beauty reduces to the beauty of the divine mind that undergirds Shaftesbury s aesthetic realism and hence his absolutism But Hutcheson has neither this nor any substitute view by which to prop up an alternative version of realism and settles hesitantly on a version of idealism and hence relativism that understands the idea of beauty on the model of an idea of a Lockean secondary quality Moreover there seems to be no necessity that the idea of beauty should arise as it does in response to objects having uniformity amidst variety Had it pleased him to do so God might have given us a sense of beauty responsive to irregularity amidst simplicity Hutcheson But that God might not have given us a sense of beauty responsive to uniformity amidst variety raises the question why he did Though it is a question that never arises for Shaftesbury Hutcheson gives it an answer that narrows the distance between the two As Shaftesbury had famously stressed the universe is highly ordered at least Uniformity Proportion and Similitude are diffused thro all the Parts of Nature which we can observe Hutcheson In such a universe t he manner of Knowledge by universal Theorems must be most convenient for Beings of limited Understanding and Power Hutcheson But if such is the manner of knowledge most convenient for beings such as us a benevolent God may be expected to provide some immediate motive a motive that is that does not require that we reflect on what is most convenient for us to our pursuit of it Because a theorem by nature possesses uniformity amidst variety a theorem simply is the unification of various particulars under a single principle Hutcheson it stands to reason that So it is in the perception of objects of intellect theorems namely that the internal sense of beauty has its raison d tre and it is by resembling theorems in point of uniformity that other objects including material objects are beautiful In this way Hutcheson recovers an element of Shaftesbury s theory that had apparently been lost in his transformation of Shaftesbury s notion of internal sense he recovers a priority of the intellectual over the material as object of beauty This is not to say however that Hutcheson recovers Shaftesbury s priority exactly Shaftesbury s priority is reductive having its ground in the distinction he draws between representative and original beauty Hutcheson draws no corresponding distinction and so allows material objects to be beautiful in their own right That difference is consequential If material objects can be beautiful then the sense by which we find them so must be capable of training outward If the notion of internal sense that Hutcheson took over from Shaftesbury is essentially the one we find in Augustine Plotinus and Plato the notion of aesthetic perception that Hutcheson left to us is essentially the one we find in Frank Sibley Sibley Hume takes his notion of taste over from Hutcheson He regards taste as an internal sense which depends on the operation of other mental faculties to pave the way for its pronouncements by supplying it with an object upon which to pronounce Hume Which mental faculties must operate and which operations those faculties must perform varies from object to object Hume shows less interest than Hutcheson does in determining which feature or features of objects result in our finding them beautiful Hutcheson it will be recalled argues that we take the pleasure of beauty in response to all and only objects in which we find uniformity amidst variety Hume resists any such tidy formula speaking of multiple principles of taste The only time he elaborates on any particular principle is in The Treatise where he holds contra Hutcheson that the beauty we find in many objects owes at least in part to their usefulness Hutcheson had denied that the usefulness of an object could play any role in our finding it beautiful on the grounds that judgments of taste are necessarily disinterested whereas judgments of usefulness are necessarily interested Against this Hume observes that judgments of taste are necessarily disinterested only in the sense that they are necessarily non self interested and that I might therefore judge a chair to be beautiful on the basis of its being useful to someone though not on the basis that it is useful to me Hume Hume follows Hutcheson in regarding the idea of beauty as analogous to a Lockean secondary quality and so follows Hutcheson in holding beauty to be subjective having no existence outside of the mind that contemplates it Hume But Hume reckons more directly than Hutcheson does with the price such a subjectivism exacts namely its apparent inconsistency with our practice of counting some judgments of beauty as correct and others as incorrect This reckoning starts with the observation that the subjectivity of colors is no barrier to our counting some color judgments correct and some incorrect Anyone who has the idea of redness can recognize the conditions under which we count an object as veridically manifesting redness namely its appearance in day light to the eye of a man in health Hume Similarly Hume holds that anyone with the idea of beauty can recognize the conditions under which we count an object as veridically manifesting beauty Hume These conditions are the appearance of beauty to those whose taste is delicate Hume who have practiced Hume who have made certain comparisons Hume who lack prejudice Hume and whose understanding is sound Hume Conditions and are evidently supposed to guarantee that the object is grasped as having all and only the aesthetically relevant properties it has whereas conditions and are evidently supposed to guarantee that a properly calibrated sentiment arises from the object as grasped In sum we take an object s beauty to appear as it is according to Hume when and only when the right sentiment arises from the object rightly grasped Thomas Reid s theory of taste as developed in the final essay of his Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man first published in makes use of a range of theoretical resources that had become available by the last decades of the Eighteenth Century Its account of sublimity owes to Burke its treatment of novelty owes to Addison and to Gerard the use it makes of association may owe to Gerard as well But as an internal sense theory its debt is principally to Hutcheson and to Shaftesbury Reid adheres to Hutcheson s notion of internal sense rather than to Shaftesbury s Indeed Reid s account of Hutcheson s notion is arguably sharper than any Hutcheson ever gives But while Reid agrees with Hutcheson about what makes the sense of beauty internal he disagrees with Hutcheson about what is ingredient to that sense Reid Hutcheson as Reid understands him posits but one ingredient an agreeable feeling or emotion resembling nothing in the object But it is in restricting himself to this single affective ingredient Reid thinks that Hutcheson puts himself on the path to Lockean anti realism with respect to beauty since it may be thought that if the sensation of beauty consists merely in such a feeling it refers to nothing in the object and if it refers to nothing in the object then it must refer merely to the perception of some Mind Hutcheson Reid takes this position to be not so much an error in judgment as an abuse of words Reid There are words by which one may say of Virgil s Georgics that it is the cause of a feeling but these are not the words The Georgics is beautiful there is no reason to think they say anything of The Georgics other than that it has the property of beauty Reid Hence a theory of taste that does not contradict the universal sense of mankind as expressed by their language Reid must allow the internal sense of beauty to have in addition to its affective ingredient a cognitive one a judgment ascribing a property to the object Reid appears to acknowledge that allowing the sense of beauty this cognitive dimension does not commit one to realism regarding beauty he appears to acknowledge that it is one thing to allow that the deliverances of internal sense comprise judgments and yet another to allow that the positive judgments they sometimes comprise are sometimes true Reid The case Reid makes for realism regarding beauty and sublimity is complex He makes a straightforward appeal to common sense Reid He argues after Descartes that our possession of an inherently fallacious sense would make a deceiver of God Reid But his deepest and most complicated reason for thinking beauty real has to do with the nature of the properties that he takes to ground beauty Following Burke Reid identifies the affect properly inspired by beautiful objects as love this contrasts with the affect properly inspired by sublime objects which he identifies as admiration Since we properly love only what is good the properties that properly inspire love must be perfections or excellences of some kind It follows that the beauty of an object has its ground in whatever perfections properly inspire our love for it and so has whatever reality those perfections have Reid concedes that we are only sometimes able to specify the perfections in virtue of which we judge things beautiful He refers to judgments in which the perfection cannot be specified as instinctive and judgments in which it can be as rational Reid Hence it is necessarily from an incomplete set of data that his enquiry into beauty grounding perfections proceeds That enquiry begins with a consideration of those perfections in virtue of which we judge minds beautiful that is the perfections that inspire love for the minds that possess them Reid finds that these perfections divide into three classes first the amiable moral virtues which include i nnocence gentleness condescension humanity natural affection public spirit second the amiable intellectual talents which include knowledge good sense wit humour cheerfulness good taste excellence in any of the fine arts and third certain perfections pertaining to the mind s active powers perfections that render the body a fit instrument for the mind including health strength and agility Reid Reid finds further that these perfections are not relative to human nature but absolute Thus Reid concludes that t here is therefore a real intrinsic excellence in some qualities of mind as in power knowledge wisdom virtue magnanimity and that a mind in possession of such qualities is therein really beautiful Reid When Reid enquires next after the perfections in virtue of which we ascribe beauty to material objects his account takes a Shaftesburian turn Reid revives Shaftesbury s distinction between original and representative beauty though he prefers the term derived to representative and also Shaftesbury s claim that the beauty of material objects derives from the original beauty of minds This allows him to maintain that the perfections in virtue of which we attribute beauty to material objects just are the perfections in virtue of which we attribute beauty to minds But whereas Shaftesbury simply infers without further argument the reduction of material to mental beauty from the premise that material beauty is the effect of mind Reid takes up instance after instance of material beauty arguing with respect to each that it is best understood as a sign of some instance of mental beauty The beauty we attribute to inanimate nature signifies the wisdom and goodness of the mind that fashioned it for our use Reid the beauty we attribute to animals insofar as we regard them as minded signifies their instincts their appetites their affections their sagacity Reid the beauty we attribute to the human form signifies either some perfection of the body as a part of the man and an instrument of the mind or some amiable quality or attribute of the mind itself Reid It may be objected that such a reduction of material to mental beauty cannot serve Reid s case for realism at least as it applies to material objects For it may seem that the beauty we attribute to material objects can never be real by Reid s lights given that no material object ever can have any of the mental perfections capable of grounding beauty But such an objection misses a subtlety of Reid s position Strictly speaking material objects never are beautiful But this does not imply that the beauty that we attribute to them never is real It is real at least generally though strictly speaking it belongs only to the minds that the material objects in question signify If it seems to us that these objects themselves possess beauty this is because beauty is prone to be transferred or communicated from the minds that really have it to the material objects that merely signify it Reid Reid never uses the term association to refer to the mechanism by which beauty is thus communicated from mental signified to material sign But that he does not distance himself from association the mechanism by then at the center of a great deal of theorizing about taste makes it hard to deny that it has found a positive role in his own theory Joseph Addison s theory of taste resides principally in the work Addison refers to as his essay on the pleasures of the imagination Addison and Steele nos and It comprises eleven papers nos through appearing in the journal The Spectator on successive days during the summer of The timing of the essay s publication raises questions about its relation to Shaftesbury s Characteristics which had appeared one year earlier But it is difficult to detect even a hint of Shaftesbury s theory of taste in Addison s That the two theories deeply oppose one another might suggest that Addison s is a reaction against Shaftesbury s But Addison does not engage Shaftesbury rather he tends simply to assume what Shaftesbury simply denies and vice versa Moreover Addison understood himself to be undertaking something entirely new in advancing a theory of taste Addison and Steele no It seems best to conclude therefore that there are two original British theories of taste While it would be hard to say which was more influential it is easy to say that each was greatly so every subsequent British theory of taste at least until the close of the Eighteenth Century shows the strong influence of one the other or both Addison s fundamental idea is that the pleasures of taste are pleasures of the imagination This should not be taken to imply that Addison identifies taste with the imagination Taste is a faculty of judgment it discerns the perfections of an author with pleasure Addison and Steele no Imagination is a faculty of representation it represents things in images it is the faculty of visual representation Addison and Steele no Hence Addison s fundamental idea comes to this apparently taste judges what the imagination represents the perfections that taste discerns with pleasure are perfections that things have as objects of visual representation But if objects of taste are objects of visual representation then objects of taste are first and foremost material objects mountain ranges waterfalls sexually attractive bodies are among the paradigms Addison offers Addison and Steele no It is here that the contrast with Shaftesbury becomes plain It will be recalled that Shaftesbury holds objects of taste to be first and foremost objects of intellect and that the fundamental difficulty that his theory must overcome is to explain our intuition that material objects are also capable of beauty With Addison it is just the reverse Addison distinguishes two classes of pleasures of the imagination primary pleasures which derive from images of objects currently present to sight and secondary pleasures which derive from images of objects currently absent from sight and so called up before the mind in some other way He then divides primary pleasures into three classes those proceeding from the sight of what is great or sublime those proceeding from the sight of what is novel and those proceeding from the sight of what is beautiful A great object is one so large as to strain the imagination s capacity to render it its apprehension flings the mind into a pleasing astonishment and a delightful stillness and amazement Addison and Steele no A novel object is one new or strange to their viewer its apprehension fills the soul with an agreeable surprise and gratifies its curiosity Addison and Steele no A beautiful object is either an object of sexual attraction or one possessing a gaiety or variety of colors or a symmetry or proportion of parts Addison and Steele no the apprehension of beautiful objects strikes the mind with a secret i e inexplicable satisfaction and complacency Addison and Steele no Addison s chief interest in secondary pleasures owes to their comprising the pleasures of artistic representation representational artworks he maintains function centrally to call up mental images of objects that are great novel or beautiful So Homer excels in the representation of great things Virgil in the representation of beautiful things Ovid in the representation of novel things and Milton in the representation of all three Addison and Steele no But Addison acknowledges that this account of the pleasures of artistic representation is so far incomplete indeed he devotes a good portion the latter part of the essay to its supplementation It seems clear for starters that our interest in artistic representations is not exhausted by our interest in what they represent we take pleasure in the representations themselves as representations To supply this deficiency Addison proposes a a new principle of pleasure which is nothing else but the action of the mind which compares the ideas that arise from the representation with the ideas that arise from the objects themselves Addison and Steele no The description of a beautiful scene pleases us according to this proposal both for the beauty of the scene and for the aptness of the description to excite its image Addison and Steele no But Addison himself seems less than fully convinced by this proposal since there is no reason to think of a pleasure arising from an act of comparison as a pleasure of the imagination such a pleasure he concedes may be more properly called the pleasure of the understanding Addison and Steele no A second deficiency concerns our interest in the artistic representations of things positively disagreeable such as our interest in the performances of tragedies The difficulty is that it seems we ought always to prefer representations of the agreeable since they alone are capable of pleasing according to both principles so far advanced Hence Addison recruits a third principle of pleasure representations of the disagreeable please us by the contrast they present between the disagreeable scene they represent and the comparatively agreeable situation in which we find ourselves A third perceived deficiency derives from the common intuition that some pleasures of artistic representation derive from the representation of purely intellectual objects such as abstract moral critical or scientific truths Addison concedes the truth of this intuition but maintains that pleasures derived from the representation of such intellectual objects are pleasures of taste only insofar as the objects are represented metaphorically as having material form The materialist basis of Addison s theory disposes it to a relativism and so to an anti realism with respect to the perfections of taste much as the intellectualist basis of the theories of Shaftesbury and Reid disposes them to an absolutism and so to a realism Because the pleasures of taste are pleasures taken merely in the visual representation of material objects there is no reason to think any creature capable of visual representation incapable of such pleasures But there is also no reason to think all creatures capable of such pleasures capable of all the same pleasures from all the same objects Indeed there is every reason to think that Hence Addison concludes that t here is not perhaps any real beauty more in one piece of matter than another and that beauty and also greatness and novelty presumably exists in the mind merely merely Addison and Steele nos and The conception of imagination at work in Edmund Burke s A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and the Beautiful published in is a successor to Addison s though it has undergone expansion along one dimension and contraction along another The expansion presumably responds to a problem arising from the application Addison s fundamental idea the idea that the pleasures of taste are pleasures of visual representation to objects that do not present themselves visually such as literary and musical works With respect to such objects Addison is forced to maintain either that they function mainly to prompt mental images of objects that do present themselves visually or that the pleasures they afford are not mainly pleasures of taste he takes the former line with respect to literary works and the latter apparently with respect to music Addison and Steele no It is presumably to mitigate this difficulty that Burke adopts a conception of the imagination that encompasses all five sense modalities Thus whereas for Addison one can imagine merely how things look for Burke one can also imagine how they sound taste smell and feel Though this broadened conception is not unique to Burke it is unlikely that any other theorist of taste so fully exploits its breadth each sense modality has its moment in A Philosophical Enquiry from a section on the beauty of surfaces as revealed by touch Burke to one on the sublimity of Bitters and Stenches Burke The contraction also presumably responds to problem in Addison this time to an apparent inconsistency in the conception of imagination itself Addison opposes the pleasures of the imagination to the pleasures of sense on one hand and to the pleasures of the understanding on the other Addison and Steele no But he also defines the pleasures of the imagination as those arising from the visual representation of things and allows that some of those pleasures those he calls the primary pleasures of the imagination arise from things present to vision Addison and Steele no Thus it becomes hard to say what the opposition between the pleasures of sense and the pleasures of the imagination can amount to It is presumably to relieve this tension that Burke recasts Addison s distinction between primary and secondary pleasures of the imagination as a distinction between the primary pleasures of sense and the secondary pleasures of the imagination Burke It is a complicated question whether Burke takes the primary pleasures of sense and the secondary pleasures of the imagination jointly to exhaust the pleasures of taste In the addition to A Philosophical Enquiry the Introduction on Taste Burke allows that objects of the understanding constitute a very considerable part of what are considered objects of Taste Burke But that objects of the understanding cannot be objects of taste seems a guiding assumption of much of the rest of the Enquiry consider for example Burke s claim that it is only as an object of the imagination and specifically not as an object of the understanding that God can be found sublime Burke It is worth noting moreover that in other respects Burke s theory is more thoroughly materialist than Addison s Although Addison maintains that the pleasures of taste are pleasures of the imagination his explanations as to why certain objects of imagination please are not particularly materialist He traces the pleasure we take in an unbounded view for example to our regarding it as an image of liberty Addison and Steele no Burke s tendency by contrast is to explain the pleasures of sense and imagination by appeal merely to our physical constitution He holds the delight we take in the viewing very large objects for example to be a consequence of the retina s being struck all at once or in quick succession by the relatively many light rays that very large objects reflect Burke But Burke s chief innovation consists neither in his conception of the imagination nor in the extent of his materialism but in his theory of the perfections of taste It will be recalled that Addison posits three such perfections sublimity or greatness novelty and beauty though he offers no explanation as to why there should be just these three Burke argues briefly that novelty is too superficial and ubiquitous to keep rightful company with sublimity and beauty Burke And he argues at length that sublimity keeps rightful and exclusive company with beauty on the grounds that it stands to one great class of human passions as beauty stands to the other Burke According to Burke s account of the passions which owes much to Hume s most all passions answer either to the ends of society or to the ends of self preservation Burke Moreover all societal passions turn on pleasure that is each has either pleasure or its felt absence as a constituent Burke The societal passion of love has pleasure as a constituent for example while the societal passion of grief has the felt absence of pleasure as a constituent Burke All self preservative passions by contrast turn on pain that is each has either pain or its felt absence of pain as a constituent Burke The self preservative passion of simple terror has pain as a constituent for example while the self preservative passion of astonishment a passion which arises when pain threatens though from a relatively safe distance and which combines feelings of sobriety awe and tranquility shadowed with horror has the felt absence of pain as a constituent Burke Thus there are both desirable and undesirable societal passions and desirable and undesirable self preservative passions The beautiful is that which excites the desirable societal passion of love the sublime that which excites the desirable self preservative passion of astonishment Burke The objective foundations of beauty and sublimity turn out to be largely opposing whereas the beautiful tends to the small the smooth the various the delicate the clear and the bright the sublime tends to the great the uniform the powerful the obscure and the somber Hence Burke concludes that The impact of Burke s aesthetic dualism was immediate Before its appearance the sublime could be ignored there is almost no mention of it in Shaftesbury Hutcheson or Hume Afterward it could not be indeed the major theorists of the second half of the century Reid Alison and Kant all advance substantial theories of the sublime But toward the century s end Burke s dualism began to come under pressure not from those who thought two perfections too many but from those who thought it too few Uvedale Price following suggestions in the writings of William Gilpin argued that there are objects landscapes paradigmatically which please the eye but which can be considered neither beautiful nor sublime These objects cannot be considered sublime because they need not be grand Price they cannot be considered beautiful because they are not smooth their pleasure depending on sudden protuberance and lines that cross each other in a sudden and broken manner Price Because the play of form color light and shadow afforded by such objects renders them ideal subjects for painting and drawing Gilpin referred to them as picturesque Gilpin By the end of the century the picturesque came to be regarded widely as occupying the position vacated by the novel i e that of a third perfection of taste Alexander Gerard s theory of taste advanced in his Essay on Taste is an attempt to mediate or perhaps to transcend the dispute between internal sense and imagination theorists Gerard accepts as sound Hutcheson s argument for the internal sensibility of taste that the perceptions of taste are simple that they arise immediately and that they arise necessarily show taste to be a sense that they are separate from and consequent upon those of external sense and reflection show taste to be internal Gerard But Gerard rejects what Hutcheson regards as a corollary that taste is an ultimate or irreducible power Hutcheson may have taken the irreducibility of taste to follow from the simplicity of its perceptions Or he may have taken the irreducibility of taste to follow by analogy from the irreducibility of the external senses But whether taste is irreducible depends merely on whether its perceptions can be traced to some more basic mental power Gerard believes that they can be in fact he believes that they can all be traced to certain exertions of the more basic power of the imagination Gerard Thus while taste is itself a species of sensation in respect of its principles it is justly reduced to imagination Gerard But what Gerard means by imagination is not what either Addison or Burke means though it is not wholly unrelated either Officially at least Gerard follows Addison and Burke in regarding imagination as a representational power and in opposing imagination to sense But Gerard breaks from Addison and Burke crucially in also opposing imagination to memory This allows him to group sense and memory together as representational powers that purport to present ideas in correspondence with reality and to isolate imagination as the representational power that does not That imagination is thus untethered from reality does not however imply its utter lawlessness It is governed by roughly Humean laws of association according to which it Hence another way of putting the contrast between sense and memory on the one hand and imagination on the other is to say that the former present ideas according to real bonds of union whereas the latter presents ideas according to laws of association Gerard In this way association becomes an essential element of imagination Indeed on Gerard s view there seems unofficially at least to be no real difference between association and imagination at most imagination is the locus of association So when Gerard claims that the perceptions of taste can be traced to certain exertions of imagination the exertions he has in mind are acts of association The idea roughly is this The reducibility of taste implies that the perceptions of taste which are pleasures are not natural to their objects in the way Hutcheson for example supposed Objects of taste must in other words acquire their pleasurability and association is the mechanism by which they do so Just how they do so varies and the variations are too numerous for cataloguing here There is however a basic mechanism to which Gerard recurs often in his explanations It seems that the mind forges very strong associations between its own processes and their objects such that any pleasure natural to a mental process will transfer to its object It also seems that any process that requires the mind to exert its activity and put forth its strength in order to surmount any difficulty is naturally pleasurable as is the mind s consciousness of its success in surmounting any difficulty Gerard Hence any object whose processing is difficult enough to require the relevant exertion but not so difficult as to prevent its success will give pleasure Gerard Novel objects give pleasure because their unfamiliarity renders their conception just difficult enough Gerard Sublime objects give pleasure because their sheer scale renders their conception just difficult enough Gerard Imitations give pleasure because marking resemblances between them and their originals is just difficult enough Gerard And ridiculous that is humorous objects give pleasure because marking dissonance or inconsistency amongst their elements is just difficult enough Gerard In these and similar ways Gerard reduces internal sense to imagination An important consequence of the reduction is that it allows Gerard to be neutral on the question of the primacy of the intellectual or the material with respect to objects of taste over which internal sense theorists and imagination theorists had divided Gerard unique among the major British theorists of his century shows no inclination to make one sort of object prior to the other Indeed within the essay s first pages he offers a rural prospect a scientific discovery a philosophical theory a poem and a painting all as equally uncontroversial examples of objects of taste Gerard Archibald Alison whose Essays on the Nature and Principles of Taste first appeared in follows after Gerard in several respects He follows after Gerard in holding that objects of taste are not naturally pleasurable as Hutcheson had supposed and so follows after Gerard in holding that objects of taste must acquire their pleasurability from something else that is naturally pleasurable He follows after Gerard moreover in holding that this acquisition depends centrally on association and follows after Gerard finally in holding that the naturally pleasurable something else is at least typically and at least in part a mental operation of some sort But he departs from Gerard regarding both the role of association and the identity of the naturally pleasurable mental operation Whereas Gerard holds association merely to be a vehicle by which pleasurability is transmitted from the naturally pleasurable mental operation to the object of taste Alison holds association also to be the central mental operation from which pleasurability is transmitted to the object taste The process by which Alison takes the object of taste to acquire its pleasurability is complicated It begins with the object s eliciting some simple emotion such as cheerfulness tenderness melancholy solemnity elevation terror delicacy grace dignity or majesty Alison This simple emotion then awakens a train of associated ideas such that each idea is emotionally charged and each is united to each by a single associative principle usually the principle of resemblance Alison The awakening of such a train of ideas is commonly known as the seizing of the imagination and is naturally attended with a simple pleasure Alison This pleasure combines with the pleasure attending the emotion that awakens the train and with the pleasures attending the emotions that arise from the ideas constituting the train to form the complex pleasures attending the complex emotions of taste namely the emotions of beauty and of sublimity The claim that the pleasures of beauty and sublimity are in this way complex is an important one in that it obviates any need to posit a special internal sense by which the pleasures of taste arise When the object of taste is a material object the process by which it becomes pleasurable is more complicated still The complication is that material objects are not naturally productive of any emotion they are often naturally productive of simple pleasures and pains but these are sensations merely Yet it cannot be doubted that material objects often do produce the complex emotions of beauty and sublimity and so must also produce the simple emotions that initiate unified trains of ideas of emotion Hence material objects in order to acquire the capacity to produce the complex pleasures of taste must first acquire the capacity to produce simple emotions They do so according to Alison by coming to signify through association qualities of mind that are naturally productive of emotion Alison These include both active and passive qualities of mind Just how material qualities come to be associated and hence to signify such qualities of mind is a topic Alison considers in great detail devoting separate and sometimes lengthy chapters to the sublimity and beauty of sounds Alison of colors Alison of forms Alison of motion Alison and of the human countenance and form Alison Of course the doctrine that the beauty of matter derives from the beauty of mind is not new to Alison who acknowledges a particular debt to Reid What is perhaps new at least to eighteenth century Britain is Alison s thorough uncoupling of this Platonic doctrine from that of internal sense Alison s theory of taste perhaps more than any other here considered is apt to strike the present day aesthetician as alien to her concerns But it is perhaps not so alien Alison differs from his present day counterpart by defining the qualities she now terms aesthetic according to the distinctive emotions he takes each to produce Hence many of Alison s claims about the emotions of beauty and sublimity and about the simple emotions on which these depend can be translated into claims about aesthetic qualities Consider for example the claim central and distinctive to Alison s theory that the emotions of beauty and sublimity depend on simple emotions such as delicacy grace dignity and majesty Surely it is a precursor to present day claims about the dependence e g the supervenience of comparatively evaluative aesthetic qualities on comparatively descriptive aesthetic qualities aesthetic concept of the

The past decades have seen an explosion of feminist writing on the philosophical canon a development that has clear parallels in other disciplines like literature and art history Since most of the writing is in one way or another critical of the tradition a natural question to ask is Why does the history of philosophy have importance for feminist philosophers This entry answers the question by exploring the different ways that feminist philosophers are interacting with the European philosophical canon While this entry focuses on feminist engagement with European philosophy recent research has highlighted for instance the construction of womanhood in Chinese Philosophy R Wang and seventeenth century Korean women writing in the Confucian tradition Ivanhoe H Y Wang Waithe and Boos Dykeman provide a resource for recovering the women philosophers in non European traditions We cannot cover this broad a range of scholarship in this one article but we are optimistic that the framework applied to European philosophy here can be helpful in feminist research in the history of philosophy of other traditions Feminist philosophers engaged in a project of re reading and re forming the philosophical canon have noticed two significant areas of concern The first is the problem of historical exclusion Feminist philosophers are faced with a tradition that believes that there are no women philosophers and if there are any they are unimportant Of course women are not entirely absent from the history of philosophy and that brings us to the second challenge we face Canonical philosophers have had plenty to say about women and what we are like In general terms we often find that philosophical norms like reason and objectivity are defined in contrast to matter the irrational or whatever a given philosopher associates with women and the feminine Rooney The European tradition tells us either implicitly through images and metaphors or explicitly in so many words that philosophy itself and its norms of reason and objectivity exclude everything that is feminine or associated with women In response feminist philosophers have criticized both the historical exclusion of women from the philosophical tradition and the negative characterization of women or the feminine in it The following entry contains major sections Section Feminist Criticisms of the Canon as Misogynist describes feminist readings of the philosophical canon that challenge its derogatory characterizations of women These are of three kinds a readings that record the explicit misogyny of great philosophers like Aristotle s description of a female as as it were a deformed male b readings that argue for gendered interpretations of theoretical concepts like matter and form in Aristotle c synoptic interpretations of the canon like the view that historically reason and objectivity are gendered male Section Feminist Revisions of the History of Philosophy discusses the response of feminist historians to the twin myths that there have been no women philosophers and in any case no important ones One response has been the retrieval of women philosophers for the historical record A related development is the elevation to the canon of important women philosophers like Mary Wollstonecraft Hannah Arendt and Simone de Beauvoir Finally feminist revisions to the history of philosophy and the canon raise important and pressing questions concerning how to weave women philosophers securely into the story of philosophy so that they begin to appear in the philosophical curriculum This includes women of color and issues of race Section Feminist Appropriation of Canonical Philosophers examines the way that feminist philosophers have been engaged in rereading the canon looking for antecedents to feminist philosophy in the work of those philosophers e g Hume and those theories e g Aristotle s virtue ethics that are most congenial to current trends in feminism or which provide most fuel for feminist thought This is to use the canon as other movements have done as a resource and as confirmation that a feminist perspective or problem is securely rooted in our philosophical culture Feminists who are critical of traditional methods of reading the history of philosophy have proposed several alternative reading strategies that they argue are better suited to feminist purposes than traditional methods These writers are particularly skeptical of the appropriation project outlined in section and their skepticism provokes interesting questions about what it is we do when we do the history of philosophy Freeland Le Doeuff Is there any principle of unity common to the four distinct projects described in this entry Feminist historians of philosophy who work on work with and work against the history of philosophy as traditionally conceived are challenging the philosophical community to recognize new figures as philosophers new genres as philosophical new uses of canonical texts as legitimate and new critical perspectives on them as valuable One way to unify the various strands of feminist work on the history of philosophy is to think of it as a recognition project Witt Using the concept of recognition as the thread that weaves through and unifies feminist engagements with the history of philosophy allows us to appreciate this important work as both an epistemic and a political achievement The idea that the gender of philosophers is important or even relevant to their work is a thought that runs counter to the self image of philosophy So it is interesting to explore how and why feminist philosophers came to the realization that gender is a useful analytic category to apply to the history of philosophy Witt We can distinguish two aspects to this process although in many cases the two aspects merge into a single project The first stage of realizing the importance of gender consisted of the cataloging of the explicit misogyny found in most of the canon The second stage consisted of probing the theories of canonical philosophers in order to uncover the gender bias lurking in their supposedly universal theories The second stage the discovery that a philosopher s supposedly universal and objective theories were gender specific raised the further question of whether or not the theoretical gender bias was intrinsic to the theory or extrinsic to it Let me illustrate these points with Aristotle There is no doubt that Aristotle s texts contains statement that are sexist perhaps even misogynist he thought that women were inferior to men and he said so explicitly For example to cite Cynthia Freeland s catalog Aristotle says that the courage of a man lies in commanding a woman s lies in obeying that matter yearns for form as the female for the male and the ugly for the beautiful that women have fewer teeth than men that a female is an incomplete male or as it were a deformity which contributes only matter and not form to the generation of offspring that in general a woman is perhaps an inferior being that female characters in a tragedy will be inappropriate if they are too brave or too clever Freeland However dispiriting or annoying this litany is and whatever problems it presents to a woman studying or teaching Aristotle it can be argued that Aristotle simply held a mistaken view about women and their capacities as did most Athenians of his time But if this is so then Aristotle s theories or most of them are not tarnished by his statements about women and we can ignore them since they are false Here Aristotle is the chosen example but similar feminist critiques are available chronicling the explicit misogyny of other canonical figures like Plato Tuana and Kant Schott Feminist criticisms of Plato s theories stress dialogues like the Timaeus and Laws that characterize women as inferior to men rather than the more egalitarian Republic Kant s writings like Aristotle s provide the ideal target for feminist criticism because they contain both overt statements of sexism and racism and a theoretical framework that can be interpreted along gender lines As an example of a gendered interpretation of a philosophical concept let s consider Aristotle s theory of hylomorphism where we find a connection between form and being male and matter and being female That is we find that matter and form are gendered notions in Aristotle Witt By a gendered notion we mean a notion that is connected either overtly or covertly either explicitly or metaphorically with gender or sexual difference Furthermore matter and form are not equal partners in Aristotle s metaphysics form is better than matter And since hylomorphism is the conceptual framework that underlies much Aristotelian theory from metaphysics and philosophy of mind to biology and literary theory it looks as if his supposedly universal and objective theories are gendered in a way that tarnishes his philosophical theories Freeland Are Aristotle s theories intrinsically gendered and sexist so that gender cannot be removed without altering the theories themselves Several feminist philosophers have developed this thesis For example in Woman Is Not a Rational Animal Lynda Lange argues that Aristotle s theory of sex difference is implicated in every piece of Aristotle s metaphysical jargon and she concludes that it is not at all clear that it Aristotle s theory of sex difference can simply be cut away without any reflection on the status of the rest of the philosophy Lange Elizabeth Spelman has argued that Aristotle s politicized metaphysics is reflected in his theory of soul which in turn is used to justify the subordination of women in the Politics Spelman And finally Susan Okin has argued that Aristotle s functionalist theory of form was devised by Aristotle in order to legitimate the political status quo in Athens including slavery and the inequality of women Okin ch More recently Emanuela Bianchi argues for an interpretation of Aristotle s texts that centers the concepts of sex and gender and thereby establishes Aristotle s structural commitment to gender hierarchy And Adriel Trott both makes the case for an enriched and nuanced interpretation of the relationship between matter and form in Aristotle s metaphysics and biology and nonetheless retains the view that matter and form are intrinsically gendered notions in Aristotle Finally Mercer argues that Aristotle s sexism follows directly from his teleological worldview and normative view of nature Important recent work on sexism in Aristotle s philosophy focuses on his theory of animal reproduction in the biological writings To what extent and in what ways is Aristotle s theory of animal generation sexist Henry Nielsen Sophia Connell interprets Aristotle s theory of animal reproduction as recognizing different potentials coming from both male and female parents and as not intrinsically sexist because the theory does not require that one source be better than the other A related issue concerns how or whether Aristotle s view of sexual difference in the biology is connected to his ideas about gender hierarchy in the Politics Deslauriers Some argue that the biology of female animals lays the foundation for and perhaps even explains the unequal and subordinate political status attributed by Aristotle to women citizens in the polis Mercer Deslauriers Feminist critics working on the history of philosophy have urged that the canon s central philosophical norms and values like reason and objectivity are themselves gendered notions The synoptic approach considers the European philosophical tradition as a whole and argues that its core concepts are gendered male or are sexist or both But if this is so then the European philosophical tradition as a whole and the central concepts that we have inherited from it requires critical scrutiny by feminists Moreover philosophy s self image as universal and objective rather than particular and biased is mistaken Feminist synoptic interpretations of the canon take several forms Lloyd The first exemplified by Genevieve Lloyd s Man of Reason argues that reason and objectivity in the history of philosophy are gendered male The way that reason and objectivity are gendered male varies as philosophical theory and historical period varies but the fact that they are gendered is a constant From Aristotle to Hume from Plato to Sartre reason is associated with maleness Therefore the notion of reason that we have inherited whether we are empiricists or existentialists requires critical scrutiny For Lloyd the maleness of reason is symbolic and metaphorical rather than cultural or psychological Lloyd does not intend the maleness of reason to refer to either a socially constituted gender category or a psychological orientation shared by males A second form of synoptic interpretation exemplified by Susan Bordo s The Flight to Objectivity argues that the modern period in philosophy and in particular the philosophy of Descartes is the source of our ideals of reason and objectivity that are gendered male In other words this story chronicles a turn in philosophy coincident with the rise of modern science which generated ideals of reason and objectivity that are deeply antagonistic to women and feminism Cartesian rationalism and the norms of modern science mark a decisive break with a philosophical and cultural tradition that was more accommodating of female characteristics and powers Finally Luce Irigaray takes a radical stance towards the history of philosophy by trying to indicate what is suppressed and hidden in the tradition rather than cataloging its evident maleness Her work like Bordo s makes use of psychoanalytic theory in interpreting texts and like Genevieve Lloyd s it explores the symbolic associations of philosophical images and concepts However unlike Bordo and Lloyd Irigaray uses highly unconventional methods of interpreting canonical philosophical texts in order to uncover the ways in which the feminine or sexual difference is repressed in them For example Irigaray uses humor and parody rather than straightforward exegesis and she points to instabilities contradictions in philosophical texts as symptoms of patriarchal thinking According to Irigaray patriarchal thinking attempts to achieve universality by repressing sexual difference But the presence of contradictions or instabilities in a philosophical text is symptomatic of the failure of patriarchal thinking to contain sexual difference For example Irigaray might look at the argument we described above for considering gender associations with form and matter in Aristotle to be extrinsic rather than intrinsic to those concepts and argue that the fact that Aristotle s hylomorphism as a universal theory is incompatible with gender associations is a symptom of patriarchal thinking rather than evidence that the proposed interpretation is mistaken Despite their different historical stories and the different ways that they understand the maleness of reason each of these panoramic visions of the history of philosophy deliver the same moral which is that the central norms that inform our philosophical culture today are gendered male Hence these synoptic narratives of the philosophical tradition provide historical justifications for feminist philosophers who are critical of our central philosophical norms of reason and objectivity Does the feminist synoptic critical reading of the history of philosophy justify either the conclusion that traditional conceptions of reason ought to be flat out rejected by feminists or the conclusion that traditional conceptions of reason ought to be subjected to critical scrutiny Even if feminist historical arguments are successful in showing that philosophical norms like reason and objectivity are gendered male this conclusion does not justify a flat out rejection of either traditional philosophy or its norms of reason and objectivity Witt Recall the distinction introduced above between intrinsically and extrinsically gendered notions An intrinsically gendered notion is one that necessarily carries implications regarding gender i e if one were to cancel all implications concerning gender one would be left with a different notion than the original In contrast an extrinsically gendered notion typically does carry implications concerning gender but not necessarily so If the maleness of reason is extrinsic to the traditional concept of reason then the historical fact that it was a gendered notion does not justify or require its rejection by feminists If on the other hand it can be shown that the maleness of reason is intrinsic to it it still does not follow that reason ought to be rejected by feminists For the idea the reason is intrinsically male biased would justify a rejection of it only if it ought to be other than it is So what needs to be argued is that reason and objectivity would be different and better if they were not gendered male but were gender neutral gender inclusive or female But if feminist philosophers develop this argument which they need to buttress the historical argument then they are reconceptualizing traditional notions of reason and objectivity rather than rejecting them Feminist canon revision is most distinctive and arguably most radical in its retrieval of women philosophers for the historical record and in its elevation of women philosophers to the canon It is a distinctive project because other contemporary philosophical movements tend to select from an already established list of male philosophers It is a radical project because by uncovering a history of women philosophers it has destroyed the alienating myth that philosophy was and by implication is or ought to be a male preserve In A History of Women Philosophers Mary Ellen Waithe has documented at least women philosophers in the classical world women philosophers from and over from In a recent work edited with Therese Boos Dyckman Women Philosophers from Non Western Traditions the First Four Thousand Years the authors document women from traditions centered in what are contemporary India China Japan Korea Tibet Nigeria the Philippines as well as the Sufi tradition and indigenous traditions in Australia and North America And in the feminist series Re reading the Canon seven of the thirty five canonical philosophers are women including Mary Wollstonecraft Falco Hannah Arendt Honig and Simone de Beauvoir Simons What is crucial to understand is that none of the three is canonical if by that you mean included in the history of philosophy as it is told in philosophy department curricula in histories of philosophy and in scholarly writing Still there has been progress Consider that The Encyclopedia of Philosophy Edwards published in which contains articles on over philosophers did not include an entry for Wollstonecraft Arendt or de Beauvoir Moreover if the index is to be believed de Beauvoir and Wollstonecraft are not mentioned at all in any article and Hannah Arendt merits a single mention in an article on Authority Far from being canonical these women philosophers were scarcely even marginal warranting perhaps a passing reference in a survey of existentialism or political philosophy but little more By however The Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy Craig had entries for all three and also many other important women philosophers The project of retrieving women philosophers has a paradoxical relationship with contemporary feminist theory however On the one hand it is clearly a feminist project its originators were interested in establishing that women have been philosophers throughout the history of the discipline despite their routine omission from standard histories and encyclopedias of philosophy However the newly recovered women philosophers suggest that there is little overlap among three groups women philosophers feminine philosophers and feminist philosophers For many of the newly discovered women philosophers were not feminist thinkers nor did they write philosophy in a feminine voice different from their male counterparts Indeed their breadth of philosophical interests is comparable to that of male philosophers although their domain of application sometimes differs In her introduction to A History of Women Philosophers Mary Ellen Waithe comments If we except the Pythagorean women we find little differences in the ways men and women did philosophy Both have been concerned with ethics metaphysics cosmology epistemology and other areas of philosophic inquiry Waithe xxi And another editor Mary Warnock comments In the end I have not found any clear voice shared by women philosophers Warnock xlvii The women philosophers restored to the tradition by feminist hands are not all proto feminists nor do they speak in a uniform and different voice from their male peers Similarly women philosophers who are candidates for initiation into the philosophical canon like Mary Wollstonecraft Hannah Arendt and Simone de Beauvoir are a diverse crew According to Elizabeth Young Bruehl That Hannah Arendt should have become a provocative subject for feminists is startling blurb for Honig presumably because of Arendt s explicit criticism of feminism And while Wollstonecraft and de Beauvoir were both feminists they share neither a common philosophical voice nor common philosophical principles In The Vindication of the Rights of Women Wollstonecraft argued for the education of women using Enlightenment principles while Beauvoir s The Second Sex reflects her Marxist and existentialist roots The diversity of women philosophers raises the question why their recovery or re valuation is an important project for contemporary feminist theory What the retrieval of women philosophers and their inclusion in the philosophical canon has done is to challenge the myth that there are no women in the history of philosophy and the fallback position that if there are any women philosophers they are unimportant Lovers of wisdom that we all are we all benefit from the correction of these mistaken beliefs Moreover as feminists we are interested in correcting the effects of discrimination against women philosophers who were written out of history unfairly because of their gender not their philosophical ideas However what is really at issue is not philosophy s past but its present its self image as male That self image is created and maintained in part by a tacit historical justification It is a damaging self image for women philosophers today and for women who aspire to be philosophers The real significance of uncovering the presence of women in our history and in placing women in our canon is the effect that has on the way we think about the us of philosophy The rediscovery of women philosophers raises the following question How can women philosophers be re woven into the history of philosophy so that they are an integral part of that history Lisa Shapiro considering the case of women philosophers in the early modern period argues that it is not enough to simply add a woman philosopher or two to the reading list Shapiro Rather according to Shapiro we need to provide internal reasons for the inclusion of women philosophers rather than relying upon a feminist motivation on the part of the teacher or editor The history of philosophy is a story and we need to find a plot line that includes new female characters One way to do this is to show how certain women philosophers made significant contributions to the work of male philosophers on central philosophical issues We could call this the Best Supporting Actress approach in that the central cast remains male and the story line of philosophy is undisturbed It is a good strategy for several reasons it is relatively easy to accomplish and it provides an internal anchor for women philosophers On the other hand it reinforces the secondary status of women thinkers and if this were the only way of integrating women philosophers that would be an unfortunate result The wholly inadequate interpretation of Beauvoir s philosophical thought as a mere application of Jean Paul Sartre s is a good example of the limitations of this strategy Not only does is reinforce a secondary handmaiden role for Beauvoir but it also promotes a distorted understanding and appreciation of her thought Simons Alternatively we could find in the work of women philosophers issues that they have developed in a sequential fashion Shapiro suggests that there are certain philosophical issues concerning women s rationality nature and education that women philosophers of the seventeenth century discuss extensively in a sequential interactive fashion The thread extends into the following century in the work of Jean Jacques Rousseau Catharine Macaulay and Wollstonecraft Since philosophers become canonical as part of a story anchored at one end by contemporary philosophical questions that are thought to be central the task would be to make these questions ones that we turn to the tradition for help in answering And of course these are precisely the central questions posed and discussed extensively by contemporary feminism Thus the idea is that as we pose new kinds of questions to the history of philosophy we will find in women philosophers an important sequential discussion that we can securely thread into our curricula and textbooks Scholars of early modern European philosophy have made the most headway in retrieving the philosophical works of women inaugurating strategies for research and providing resources for curriculum and canon revision For this reason the discussion that follows starts with this period Scholars of other historical periods in the European tradition in particular of Medieval philosophy and nineteenth and early twentieth century philosophy have now started to follow this lead to undertake the recovery of women philosophers in those periods While it may seem odd to present the periods out of chronological order at this stage of the development of the field we think it important to record the actual history and development of the retrieval of women philosophers Contemporary scholars concerned to re integrate these women into the philosophical canon have tended to adopt a strategy that does not assume that standard philosophical concepts or the canon itself are gender biased Rather scholars aim to recover and make accessible again long out of print texts to develop interpretations of these texts that a bring out their philosophical content and b demonstrate the involvement of these women in the philosophical debates of the period The re introduction of women across the history of philosophy provides occasion to examine basic methodology in the history of philosophy The bibliographical appendix to this entry can direct readers to some recent editions of writings by historical women authors as well as secondary literature on those authors and many others beyond that cited in the article itself From about the mid s there has been a concerted effort by scholars both to rehabilitate the works of early modern women European philosophers and to integrate at least some of these women into the philosophical canon which has been focused on European intellectual history These efforts illustrate how a range of different feminist approaches to the history of philosophy can be integrated together While many contemporary philosophers have little knowledge of the women philosophers of the early modern period there are in fact good historical records of these women and their works This fact has made the doxographic task of retrieving these women thinkers a relatively straightforward one even if labor intensive O Neill catalogs a long list these women and her doxographical work has provided a starting point for both expanding the list and interpreting the philosophical works of these women The recovery of philosophical work by women is an enormous task and it requires both returning to archival methods that undergirded the development of philosophical canons in the nineteenth century and to leverage new digital methods to make texts accessible and determine lines of influence Archival methods are necessary not only to recover texts that are long out of print but also to recover materials such as pamphlets and correspondence by these women authors that provide further context Broad a Broad b Green Digital methods can also be used to help transform entrenched practices Resources like the The New Narratives Bibliography of Works by Women Philosophers of the Past lays bare publication history and can help in tracking intellectual networks Resources like Project Vox provide contentful resources and curricular support Both are being extended to other historical periods and to regions outside of the European context In addition digital editions of texts and manuscript materials like the resources on the pro woman arguments of the debate on women at Querelle and the St Petersburg manuscripts of Emilie du Ch telet help open research questions One of the central canonical themes of early modern philosophy is the reconceptualization of causation Scholastic philosophy largely understood causation on an Aristotelian model on which all change was to be explained by a constellation of four causes final formal material and efficient causes Early modern thinking about causation began with a rejection of final and formal causes Determining final causes involved a speculation that outstripped human understanding while formal causes were dismissed as occult qualities simple assertions that things worked without an intelligible explanation of how they did so Several canonical figures in early modern philosophy Descartes Spinoza Locke Hume and Kant are often situated with respect to one another through their views on causation In recent years Malebranche with his account of occasionalist causation a view on which neither bodies nor minds have causal power in themselves and God is the only efficient cause has been worked into the story What Malebranche highlights is that understanding the nature of causation was a live philosophical problem while there was agreement about dismissing final and formal causation there was much disagreement about what should replace it and in particular about the nature of efficient causation Some early modern women thinkers were very much involved in this debate and they are just as easily incorporated into the philosophical story as Malebranche For instance Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia in her correspondence with him questions Descartes about the nature of causation between mind and body She can be read as insisting that an adequate account of causation must be applicable in all causal contexts Margaret Cavendish in her Observations on the Experimental Philosophy b develops a vitalist account of causation wherein motion is not transferred from one body to another but rather one body comes to be in motion through a self patterning in harmony with another body around it The entry on Margaret Cavendish provides a more detailed summary of Cavendish s account of causation along with guidance for further reading While Cavendish s account of causation did not carry the day vitalism of one form or another was a dominant strand of thought in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries It is worth noting that vitalism is also a position within contemporary philosophy of biology A similar strategy for incorporating other women into the philosophical canon can be deployed with respect to one or another central topics such as the Principle of Sufficient Reason Emilie du Ch telet or cosmology Cavendish a b Anne Conway Damaris Masham du Ch telet see Lascano Lascano develops a comparative account of the metaphysical systems of Cavendish and Conway discussing their views on substance monism self motion individuation and identity over time as well as causation perception and freedom The entry on du Ch telet includes a helpful discussion on her position on the Principle of Sufficient Reason as well as an array of secondary sources The entries on Cavendish Masham and du Ch telet provide some detail as to their positions on particular philosophical topics A number of recent edited volumes have instead focused on a particular canonical philosophical theme and collected interpretations of a range of women philosophers focused on that particular topic Thomas collects essays on women s contributions to early modern metaphysics with essays on metaphysics of science ontology metaphysics of mind and self and the metaphysics of morality as well as on the conception of metaphysics itself covering such philosophers as Damaris Masham Cavendish Emilie du Ch telet Bathsua Makin and Anna Maria van Schurman Anne Conway Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia Mary Astell Catherine Trotter Cockburn Broad and Detlefsen focuses on women s writings on liberty and freedom in the early modern period and includes essays on Cavendish Masham Gabrielle Suchon Cockburn du Ch telet Catherine Macaulay Sophie de Grouchy Mary Wollstonecraft O Neill and Lascano collects essays on women s contributions across three broad thematic categories metaphysics epistemology and natural philosophy moral philosophy moral psychology and philosophy of mind and social and political philosophy Note that while the majority of essays in O Neill and Lascano s volume concern early modern women thinkers it is also includes women philosophers from other historical periods These edited collections bring home that no matter which canonical philosophical questions one finds interesting women philosophers made substantive contributions One can also move to incorporate women into our philosophical history by rethinking the questions through which that history is structured How the questions are framed influences who is taken to have interesting answers on offer Within the early modern period questions in epistemology are often about the nature of reason and rationality and the limits of the human understanding While women of the period sometimes address these questions theoretically more often they are concerned with implications of such answers for training the human mind For instance many women are concerned with matters of education and they directly relate positions on education to positions on the nature of human understanding and rationality and incorporate the passions into accounts of human understanding Already mentioned are the works of Anna Maria van Schurman Schurman and Mary Astell Astell but others including Madeleine de Scud ry Scud ry and Gabrielle Suchon Suchon also wrote on education Shapiro As part of their efforts to understand how we human beings learn to reason these philosophers also recognize that reasoning is intimately connected with our emotional life part of reasoning well is feeling appropriately Their discussions in which learning to reason incorporates moral education resonate not only with Spinoza Ethics Parts but also with Antoine Arnauld and Pierre Nicole s Logic or Art of Thinking and Conway s account of metaphysical truth in her Principles In these accounts a philosophical question emerges about how efforts to enable the exercise of human freedom in rationality also rely on the very same customs and habits that interfere with that freedom Shapiro It would be interesting to situate British sentimentalists such as Shaftesbury and Hume with respect to these discussions Catharine Macaulay in her Letters on Education argues that an education that cultivates the sentiment of sympathy is essential to adults properly grasping moral truths and being motivated to act on them see Gordon While education is not today typically taken to be central to philosophy a little reflection on the history of philosophy can destabilize this contemporary outlook Descartes s Discourse on Method for Rightly Conducting Reason is arguably a work about education John Locke wrote Some Thoughts Concerning Education and On the Conduct of the Understanding and Rousseau s Emile also concerns education Equally education is a central concern of philosophers predating the early modern period consider Plato in Republic and after it consider John Dewey Dewey Reconsidering education as a central question of philosophy can not only facilitate seeing women thinkers as contributing centrally to philosophical projects but also bring to the fore philosophical questions more recently fallen out of fashion but which have long been compelling Finally there are philosophical discussions that quite simply were central in the period but which until recently have been largely ignored Arguments for the equality of the two sexes emerged in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries While the so called querelle des femmes or debate on women had been going on for centuries the seventeenth century marked a turning point in the debate over the status of women as better or worse than men in virtue of their form or soul see Kelly Deslauriers Both women and men thinkers of the period advanced egalitarian arguments So for instance Marie De Gournay in her On the Equality of Men and Women and deployed a skeptical method to argue for the equality of men and women De Gournay Anna Maria van Schurman deployed syllogistic argumentation to argue for women s education both by demonstration and as evidence in her Dissertatio van Schurman in her Serious Proposal to the Ladies for the Advancement of their True and Greatest Interest Mary Astell applied Descartes s sex neutral account of the mind insofar as mind is really distinct from body rationality is not tied to sex to argue for women s education Astell Fran ois Poulain de la Barre in On the Equality of the Two Sexes also drew on Cartesian principles to argue for the social equality of men and women Poulain de la Barre Clarke collects de Gournay van Schurman and Poulain de la Barre together These discussions are interesting for a number of reasons First they highlight that philosophical questions of equality and in a form of particular interest to contemporary feminists have a history Though anachronistic it seems appropriate to characterize at least some of these women along with some of their male contemporaries as engaged in a feminist project and conversely that feminist arguments have a history that long predates the late nineteenth century arguments for women s suffrage They thus highlight a new thematic thread for the history of philosophy Second while the methods deployed by these thinkers are different they all appropriate on philosophical methods skepticism basic rules of inference a new metaphysics different from what was then the dominant Aristotelian paradigm to counter misogynist claims It is worth considering the context in which these women were writing and what it suggests about their feminist methodology in the history of philosophy Many of these thinkers were self consciously countering a recognized misogyny in philosophy but insofar as they deployed philosophical methods they would seem to reject the view that the problem was intrinsic to the discipline of philosophy itself At the same time as these strategies in retrieving the philosophy of early modern women are proving successful scholarship on the women philosophers of other historical periods is emerging and gaining momentum Scholars of medieval philosophy have finally achieved widespread consensus that philosophy between the fourth and sixteenth centuries can be found in any number of places that aren t simply texts written by Christian men in the so called Latin West Contemporary studies of European medieval philosophy thus increasingly address Greek Jewish and Islamic texts in addition to the Latin Christian canon see Marenbon Hyman Walsh Williams and Adamson Yet on the whole philosophical scholarship continues to ignore female authored texts from the Middle Ages The reason for this is simple if pernicious traditional conceptions of medieval philosophy as taking place in monasteries religious schools and university settings rule out the possibility of women authored texts because women were excluded from participating in those settings in the Christian both Latin and Greek Islamic and Jewish worlds See Allen for a careful study of primary texts justifying this exclusion as well as medieval responses to those texts In the past decade however there has been increasing recognition that the vast corpus of mystical and contemplative texts written by women throughout Europe in the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries contains much of philosophical interest Here we provide three brief examples of how medieval women engaged in central philosophical debates of their time In order to appreciate their contributions it is most helpful to take a topical rather than figure based approach Given that scholastic authors cite only figures widely recognized as authorities women s names do not appear in their texts since women were excluded from university posts we don t have the sorts of records that allow us to trace the exchange of ideas and views between specific university masters If we take a topic based approach however we can place women s writings into the general collage of developing views and important concepts Our three examples concern the following topics Self knowledge and self formation reason s role in human life and the will s role in human life The importance of self knowledge and self formation for achieving the ultimate end of human life was widely acknowledged in medieval scholastic and contemplative mystical discussions see Cory Van Dyke Whereas in scholastic texts discussions of self knowledge tend to focus on the possibility and mechanics of knowledge of self contemplative texts emphasize the ethical and spiritual motivations for and results of such knowledge with special attention paid to the virtues that both arise from and facilitate it Christine de Pizan d for instance literally builds her City of Ladies on self knowledge as the personification of Reason who holds the mirror of self knowledge in lieu of a scepter helps her lay the foundations for the city a city which then continues construction by Rectitude and finally Justice see particularly Part One c A particularly important virtue for attaining self knowledge is humility as Hadewijch d after Mechthild of Magdeburg d Marguerite Porete d and Catherine of Siena d make clear see Roberts Van Dyke Knowledge of self is also frequently paralleled with knowledge of God as when Julian of Norwich d c notes in her Showings that knowing oneself is a pre condition for knowing God while at the same time knowing God is necessary for full knowledge of oneself Showings Long Text Chapter Ultimately medieval contemplatives agree that self knowledge forms the base for all future moral and spiritual growth The faculty of reason is crucial for acquiring self knowledge but what role of reason should play in attaining our ultimate end was hotly contested outside of as well as inside university settings In her early thirteenth century Mirror of Simple Souls for instance Marguerite Porete advocates for the need to abandon human rationality altogether in the later stages of our moral and spiritual development see Porete Chapter where personified Reason actually dies At the same time Hadewijch and Catherine of Siena emphasize the importance of reason working together with will towards our ultimate goal see e g Hadewijch Letters and Catherine of Siena Dialogue Chapter Julian of Norwich portrays human rationality as sanctified via Christ s incarnation describing faith as coming from the natural love of the soul the clear light of reason and the steadfast remembrance God instilled in us when we were created Showings Chapter Finally Hildegard of Bingen d Angela of Foligno d and Margaret Ebner d go so far as to claim that union with God has enhanced their natural rational capacities allowing them to comment with authority on Scripture and engage as equals in discussions with learned men see Hildegard of Bingen Scivias Preface Angela di Foligno Memoriale IX Ebner Revelations Debates about the primacy of the will and love in union with God are also central to medieval contemplative mystical as well as scholastic texts particularly in the late thirteenth fifteenth centuries The will is one of the two faculties that human beings were said to share with God the other being intellect and directing our wills towards their proper object God was seen as the highest form of love For Marguerite Porete the final stages of spiritual growth culminated in such complete surrender of will that the self itself became annihilated and only God remained see J M Robinson King Hadewijch Mechthild of Magdeburg Angela of Foligno Catherine of Siena and Julian of Norwich also depict love as the most important component of the moral and spiritual life maintaining that love increases knowledge in an upward spiral that negates the need for formal university training The most famous expression of this view is Thomas Kempis s fifteenth century Imitation of Christ which is indebted to these earlier discussions Whether our ultimate goal as human beings is to transcend our embodied existence to merge selflessly with God however that might achieve or whether our ultimate end is the fulfillment of human nature in its individuality and what this might entail remains controversial throughout the Middle Ages Julian of Norwich is perhaps the best example of someone who celebrates the fulfillment of intellect and will in union with God without seeing that union as erasing the individuality of human nature see Showings Long Text Significant new work is underway to unearth the rich history of women s philosophizing in both the German speaking and English speaking worlds of the late eighteenth nineteenth and early twentieth centuries Recent work has shown that German women were intentionally excluded from German histories of philosophy Ebbersmeyer and so despite these women thinkers having written in the relatively recent past they have already gone missing Scholars are now deploying the strategies that have been used successfully in recovering the philosophical work of women in the early modern period to identify women intellectuals whose work is philosophical recover their writings and make them accessible through re editions and translations develop interpretations of their work that takes care to highlight central philosophical themes they address and situate these women with respect to canonical figures and philosophical movements Dyck provides a set of ground breaking essays that highlight women in eighteenth century and early nineteenth century German philosophy Essays document women s involvement in Leibnizian Wolffian philosophy Sophie of Hanover and Johanna Charlotte Unzer their contributions to the philosophy of education Dorothea Christiane Erxleben and Amalia Holst their engagement with Enlightenment debates Wilhelmine of Bayreuth and Elise Reimarus and Kantianism Maria von Herbert and Theodor von Hippel on the status of women in Germany as well as the legacy of German philosophy in the nineteenth century especially through the writings of French Swiss author Germaine de Sta l and American abolitionist Lydia Maria Child In his introduction to the volume Corey Dyck distinguishes among discussing women philosophers women in philosophy and women and philosophy drawing attention to questions about what counts as philosophy and who counts as a philosopher both within a particular historical context and contemporary conceptions of philosophy Kristin Gjesdal and Dalia Nassar have recently co edited both a volume of primary text translations by German women philosophers of the nineteenth century as well as an Oxford Handbook of Nineteenth Century Philosophers in the German Tradition which includes the first efforts of interpretive scholarship on many of these figures Women philosophers discussed in detail include Dorothea von Schlegel Rahel Varnhagen Bettina von Arnim Rosa Luxemburg Edith Landmann Kalischer and Edith Stein The volume highlights women s contributions to the philosophy of nature philosophy of science philosophy of language moral philosophy and aesthetics as well as Spinozism pessimism and empiricism It details women s participation in philosophical movements including Idealism Romanticism Neo Kantianism and Phenomenology Lydia Moland and Alison Stone have also recently co edited a companion Oxford Handbook of American and British Women Philosophers in the Nineteenth Century Individual women philosophers discussed include Mary Shepherd on metaphysics Ednah Dow Cheney on aesthetics Marietta Kies on moral philosophy Mary Shelley on philosophizing through literature and E E C Jones on the philosophy of language In the nineteenth century in the United States Black women philosophers such as Sojourner Truth Anna Julia Cooper Frances Watkins Harper and Maria Stewart also contributed substantially to philosophical discussions Women philosophers of the period in the English speaking world contributed not only to intellectual movements from socialism to pragmatism to transcendentalism but also directly to the philosophical foundations of social movements including those for suffrage abolition pacifism and the philosophy of education Addressing the contributions of nineteenth century African American women to philosophy though not only entails identifying what traditional philosophical topics or issues they engaged but also how they engaged them Political and moral philosophy and more particularly natural law theory and its relation to theology and Christian ethics tend to constitute the traditional forms of philosophy that they engaged while embodied forms of rationality particularly in terms of race and gender as discussed by philosophers Emmanuel Chukwudi Eze and Linda Mart n Alcoff constitute how they engaged these topics Eze Alcoff Race however played a major role in both Historian Joan Bryant recently argued that race was a complicated phenomenon in nineteenth century America that went well beyond biological references particularly for nineteenth century African American male social reformers and thinkers Bryant As a set of disparate ideas and assorted practices that structured human difference hierarchy sameness and consciousness for these reluctant race men as she dubs them race s complexity included a slippage in meaning due to its many configurations and functions Bryant As partners of these men nineteenth century African American female social reformers and thinkers philosophized within the context of this complicated phenomenon of race as well However the historical social and political context in which these Black women philosophized still meant dealing with the biological assumptions that Euro Americans held about them and their people since these assumptions were first and foremost about power and control The prevalence of slavery and anti Black racism in the United States made the idea of a thinking creative and expressive Black woman much less one that could philosophize foreign to most Whites Early attempts by anti slavery advocates to demonstrate that Blacks could be equal to Whites in reasoning and cultural accomplishments were met with incredulity even outright rejection Thomas Jefferson s dismissal of Phillis Wheatley an African slave girl whose poetry was celebrated on both sides of the Atlantic in the late eighteenth century is exemplary of such incredulity and rejection Jefferson As philosopher Devonya Havis recently argued though there was more at stake than a repudiation of her skill the primary issue was that Wheatley represented a quintessential disruption in the ideological restriction of the humanness of Blackness Black people were simply not human or at least not in the same way as Whites Like Wheatley then nineteenth century African American women social reformers and thinkers such as Maria W Stewart Mary Ann Shadd Cary Frances Ellen Watkins Harper and Anna Julia Hayward Cooper had first to defend themselves and their people as human beings with all the abilities feelings and rights of Whites before they could defend themselves as women To this end and from the standpoint of their own experiences to use philosopher Julie K Ward s apt phrasing they demonstrated their abilities to philosophize by synthesizing anew the discourses of freedom available to them Ward This included the universal humanism in British philosopher John Locke s natural law theory which informed the nation s founding documents and the equality of all people in the Hebraic and Christian scriptures whose moral authority Locke used to support his articulation of natural law In other words as Emmanuel Eze might put it Stewart Cary Harper and Cooper reasoned vernacularly by re constructing philosophical and theological discourses on human being through their experiences so that they might elicit shared moral judgments about human being and human relations from their White audiences Eze xvi xviii The idea of human being that Stewart Cary Harper and Cooper engaged in the political philosophy grounding and informing the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution was the enlightened idea that Locke had formulated in his Essays on the Law of Nature from the s and elaborated in his Two Treatises of Government from and his Essay Concerning Human Understanding from Jefferson Locke c Locke Locke Locke Locke maintained that an enlightened or liberal society based on a practical or empirical understanding of human being as opposed to an essential or metaphysical one could be oriented around self interest that is as concern for one s material well being ongoing betterment and contentment and as such sanctioned by divine or natural law and protected by government Darwall Woolhouse Locke c Locke Locke In a century after Locke published his Essays on the Law of Nature nearly a century after he published his Two Treatises of Government and nearly a century after many English colonists had not only become familiar with Locke s Treatises but had also begun to appropriate his ideas of human being and property in order to promote colonial expansion and individual betterment Arneil Jefferson presented this cluster of ideas in Locke s theory along with several others in the soon to be famous lines of the Declaration of Independence We hold these truths to be self evident that all Men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights that among these are Life Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness That to secure these Rights Governments are instituted among Men deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed Jefferson Jefferson made Locke s practical idea of human being a rational being only motivated by self interest and Locke s ethics based upon that idea a divine command to function in this way the centerpiece of a new republic focused on human rights with a government focused on the protection of those rights and of property Darwall Miller Arneil As the pursuit of happiness or the ability to create one s own empirical or material well being ongoing betterment and contentment included property in African slaves for many of the founders Jefferson included in spite of his promotion of liberty and denouncements of slavery and in spite of Locke s ultimate distancing of himself from slavery a parallel stream of anti slavery arguments challenged Locke s and especially Jefferson s positions particularly on religious and moral grounds Jefferson Jefferson Jefferson Miller Locke c Locke Locke Wootton Arneil Uzgalis Woolhouse Moore M C Robinson British thinkers such as the writer Samuel Johnson and Anglican divine John Wesley critiqued Great Britain for the immorality and abuses that slavery produced as part of the nation s unchecked expansionism or pursuit of economic aspirations through colonizing ventures particularly as they negatively affected both persons of African descent and Indigenous peoples Moore M C Robinson It was social reform and civic minded Quakers though who provided some of the most powerful and relentless challenges to slavery and to Jefferson s adoption of Locke s philosophy Jordan In doing so they provided basic arguments that gave women like Stewart Cary Harper and Cooper an important entry into this conversation particularly through a close family member friend or formal education Jordan M C Robinson Following George Fox the founder of Quakerism Fox leading eighteenth century Quakers such as John Woolman Anthony Benezet and David Cooper acted on religious conviction when they pointed out the violation of divine and natural law particularly in the glaring contradiction of championing freedom while robbing others of theirs Jordan In doing so though they were not so much against self interest per se that is as the pursuit of one s material well being and betterment as they were against the selfish self centeredness that an excessive and unchecked self interest could foster Jordan Maria W Stewart whom literary scholar Marilyn Richardson dubs America s first Black woman political writer Richardson a iii inherited and re synthesized these arguments in the context of her own and her people s experiences and in light of her and her deceased husband s work with Black revolutionary David Walker Richardson b by using the revolutionary discourse of the founding documents and the same passages from the book of Genesis that Locke had used to identify dignify and validate White individuals particularly White men Stewart as property producers In the process she not only critiqued Whites like Locke and Jefferson for keep ing Blacks down while they sit up yonder acting as though they are better than Blacks all so that they might justify exploiting the blood of our fathers and the tears of our brethren that have enriched their soils Stewart cf Arneil Locke c But she also encouraged indeed called Black women and men to CLAIM THEIR RIGHTS even though they had long been denied them Stewart Ratcheting up the revolutionary rhetoric she even said to Black women not just Black men to possess the spirit of men bold and enterprising fearless and undaunted so that they might sue for their rights and privileges or at least know the reason they cannot attain them so that they might be willing to die to attain them Stewart All of this rested upon Stewart s bold claim against conventions of the time that Black men and women were endowed with the same glorious image of God presented in Genesis as everyone else Many think because your skins are sable that you are an inferior race but God does not consider you as such He hath formed and fashioned you in his own glorious image and hath bestowed upon you reason and strong powers of intellect He hath made you to have dominion over the beasts of the field the fowls of the air and the fish of the sea and according to the Constitution of these United States he hath made all men free and equal It is not the color of the skin then that makes the man but the principles formed within the soul Stewart In other words she not only claimed Locke s idea of human being for Black people but she also expanded upon it in Christian ethical terms by saying that the person who possesses this image must be a person of integrity someone who will acknowledge not abuse the image of God in others as they pursue their own material well being and contentment Mary Ann Shadd Cary whom media historian Jane Rhodes identifies as the first Black woman newspaper editor and the second Black woman lawyer possessed the same radical spirit as Stewart Rhodes xi Indeed during her abolitionist career when she focused on enslaved Black women Cary appealed to New Testament ethics particularly Jesus s summary of the commandments as love of God and love of neighbor Matthew Deuteronomy Leviticus Doing so allowed her to identify slavery as an evil and a sin a common abolitionist theme that had particularly onerous effects on Black women Shadd Cary Like Stewart Cary also appreciated and appealed to the Lockean natural law theory in the nation s founding documents Indeed her letter to abolitionist Frederick Douglass then the editor of the North Star confirms this where she speaks of blacks becoming farmers so that they could be producers not merely consumers Shadd Cary In her sermon though Cary was concerned to illuminate the selfishness that could easily be validated in Locke s natural law theory especially as Jefferson and others had practiced it Hence following the Quakers she distinguished between natural law and what she took to be the higher law of God the aforementioned love of God and neighbor Shadd Cary Matthew On her view the improper implementation of natural law in the actual laws of the United States had led to the sin of slavery and with it the failure to acknowledge and respect the image of God in Black people especially Black women Shadd Cary In the duty to love God s law the higher law challenges this Shadd Cary We cannot successfully evade duty because the suffering fellow be only a woman She too is a neighbor I speak plainly because we share a common origin and because were it not for the monster slavery we could have a common destiny here in the land of our birth Shadd Cary Cary concluded then that the voice of woman must be heard above all others since she is the greatest sufferer from chattel slavery or political proscription Shadd Cary In making these claims Cary like Stewart and the Quakers was not rejecting Jefferson s Lockean idea of divinely sanctioned self interest per se She did not think that interest in one s own material well being ongoing betterment and contentment was inherently selfish She simply recognized that the founders implementation of Locke s theory had expressed such selfishness and led to the abuse and the exclusion of Black people particularly Black women As a result she viewed the divine commands to love God and neighbor as a clear check on such selfishness It defined the integrity of which Stewart spoke that would make it impossible for Whites who claimed to be Christians to ignore the image of God in Black people especially Black women Like Stewart then Cary did not merely reclaim Lockean natural law theory but she made it clear that it had to be informed and accompanied in practice by Christian ethics so that it would not become ideological idolatry in the hands of the powerful V Lloyd x xi If White men like Locke and Jefferson were going to appeal to the Bible they needed to be ready to abide by its New Testament ethics Abolitionist poet educator and all around social reformer Frances Ellen Watkins Harper agreed Like Cary and Stewart she too fought for the rights of Blacks by focusing on Black women And like Cary and Stewart she did so out of religious conviction But as intellectual historian Marcia Robinson explains Harper took a slightly different approach to the natural law theory in the nation s founding documents and Christianity s relationship to it M C Robinson Harper did not simply use religious and moral ideals to check the abuses of Jefferson s Lockean self interest as Cary and Stewart did Harper But she also took issue with the very idea that the creation myths in Genesis could be used as Locke had used them to interpret human beings almost exclusively as self interested property producers That is Harper took issue with the way that Jefferson and the other founders had deliberately excluded slavery from the Declaration of Independence thereby failing to address and to denounce it precisely where they following Locke drew upon the Bible Harper a Harper namely where Jefferson re presents Locke s unalienable rights of life liberty and property as life liberty and the pursuit of happiness as historian John Chester Miller and political scientist Barbara Arneil reveal Jefferson Miller Arneil As a result Harper faulted them for saddling the new republic with a host of injustices abuses and social problems from the start including the ongoing theft of Indigenous lands and the exploitation and abuse of Black women Harper a Harper Her primary concern then was not simply to challenge the excesses and abuses of Whites self interest so that Black people could gain access to the same rights and privileges of American citizenship as Whites even though she too was concerned about this Harper b Rather Harper s fundamental concern was the kind of human relations and human society that the nation s ideals based on human being in the image of God and elaborated by Jesus s love ethic portended Those relations she maintained should not only define and facilitate a multi racial democracy in the United States but they should also influence the actions of the nation s people at all times and in every sphere economic political social cultural and especially religious Harper b In taking this position Harper recognized that even before slavery had been abolished free Black people like herself who were aspiring to be part of the nation s middle class were also inclined to adopt the position of the property producer in America s slaveholding overly commercialized society They believed she maintained that money was a symbol of power that could gain for them the rights that power and prejudice had denied them Harper b She immediately saw the error in this belief It is no honor she reminded her fellow Black men and women seeking wealth to shake hands politically with wealthy White men and women who whip Black women and steal Black babies Harper b In other words she basically told them that they could earn all the money they wanted but that would not earn them the respect that they sought nor improve the lot of their enslaved people The important lesson we should learn she proclaimed is how to make every gift whether fortune or genius subserve the cause of crushed humanity and carry out the greatest idea of the present age the glorious idea of human brotherhood Harper b In other words for Harper the true idea of America as implied by those unalienable rights based on the image of God was the potential of and the call to right human relations Material well being and contentment were secondary The government s task however was to protect both Educator and activist Anna Julia Cooper expanded indeed went well beyond Harper s Cary s and Stewart s positions as scholars Louise Daniel Hutchinson Leona C Gabel Frances Richardson Keller Vivian M May and Vincent W Lloyd all reveal in their respective interpretations of Cooper Hutchinson Gabel F R Keller May V Lloyd To start Cooper received a formal education that allowed her to earn both a bachelor s degree and a doctorate Cooper Hutchinson Gabel As part of qualifying for the latter Cooper wrote a dissertation at the Sorbonne that took France s leading figures to task for failing to recognize the humanity of Black slaves in Saint Domingue present day Haiti even as they championed the republican ideals of freedom brotherhood and equality libert fraternit egalit another expression of the natural law tradition indeed one directly connected to the American natural law tradition Cooper As feminist scholar Vivian May maintains Cooper used both critical analysis to interrogate French political and economic history and dialectical and intersectional reasoning to point out the way in which wealthy French men s pursuits of happiness to use Jefferson s phrase Jefferson ultimately became not only a rejection of the humanity of Black people in France s former colony May ch but also a means for her to develop what would ultimately become the key terms of today s dependency theory of global political economy May ch Cooper also expanded refined and deepened the way that Black women could think about human being particularly in terms of what might best constitute the pursuit of happiness which made her both akin to and different from Jefferson or Benjamin Franklin as historian Peter Moore elaborates this idea Cooper Jefferson Moore Key to her thinking was French feminist Germaine de Sta l and her romantic idea of the self which accords with Cooper s own dialectical idea of the American experiment Cooper Berg s Following de Sta l Cooper maintained that happiness consists not in perfections attained but in a sense of progress the result of our own endeavor under conspiring circumstances toward a goal which continually advances and broadens and deepens till it is swallowed up in the Infinite Cooper Happiness for her was not in the attainment of any particular endeavor but rather in the sense of betterment that comes with striving itself that is with striving towards something unbounded or eternal that defines the human subject as human and so is able ultimately to fulfill it Hence unlike most of the nation s founders not to mention most Americans Cooper did not reduce happiness to the pursuit of material gain and pleasure Rather she grounded it in the potential fulfillment of the human subject s active spiritual moral and creative power in a state of being that has no bounds This makes Cooper s idea of the self akin not only to de Sta l s endlessly developing self but also to other eighteenth and nineteenth century philosophical ideas of the self and a long Platonic tradition in Christianity something Jefferson may well have appreciated in his more generous moments For Cooper as well as for Harper Cary and Stewart then the idea of America was the idea of human potential itself morally spiritually creatively politically and or economically conceived for each of them participated in an ongoing national conversation about this potential typically framed in terms of the meaning of America and taking place in a variety of public venues Being part of such a wide ranging conversation was not merely an academic affair Their own and their people s future rested upon its viability These efforts to recover the women philosophers of the past and their works raise a number of historiographical questions First and foremost it challenges us to think about how we arrived at the historical philosophical canon that we have in ways that move beyond the discussion in the contributions to Rorty Schneewind and Skinner Recent work by Sabrina Ebbersmeyer and by Delphine Antoine Mahut shows how political agendas have figured in the telling of philosophical history in Germany and France In these histories certain philosophical topics rose to the fore while others were discounted But in discounting the value of a set of philosophical themes these canonical histories of philosophy have also shaped the dynamics of contemporary philosophical discussions privileging some topics rather than others just as much they privilege some figures This recovery work asks us to cast a critical lens on the philosophical topics we take to be central Shapiro Second recovering the philosophical work of women requires an openness to the genres of writing proper to philosophy Work in medieval philosophy shows that women used genres of spiritual writing to advance their philosophical ideas In early modern period women used polemics poetry novels plays school curricula as well as treatises to articulate their philosophy and this use of a range of genres as well as publicly circulated forms of expression such as pamphlets newspapers and journals to engage in philosophical discussion Attending the variety of genres of philosophical writing raises questions about the boundaries of philosophy as a discipline Questions about how to demarcate philosophical work also arise in noticing that many women s philosophical work aims to directly influence public opinion for instance about the equality of men and women and indeed of all human beings and about the social and political implications of that equality including the need for and structure of educational institutions the immorality of slavery and the right to political representation through voting What is the relation between the philosophical work done in formal academic environments and that done in the public sphere Much of the work of recovering the philosophical work of women of the past has been focused squarely on the European and Anglophone philosophical traditions This focus invites questions about how the exclusion of women from the history of philosophy intersects with the exclusion of others and in particular Africana philosophers and other philosophical traditions from the history of European philosophy Feminist philosophers are also changing the history of philosophy by appropriating its ideas for feminist purposes From the perspective of feminist critique of the traditional canon the history of philosophy is a resource only in so far as it describes the theories and thinkers that were most deeply in error Other feminist historians of philosophy have found important resources for feminism in canonical philosophers Indeed they have found valuable concepts even in the worst offenders of the negative canon like Aristotle and Descartes For example in The Fragility of Goodness Martha Nussbaum has described the virtues of an Aristotelian ethics with its emphasis on the importance of concrete context emotion and care for others in an ethical life Nussbaum And Marcia Homiak has argued that Aristotle s rational ideal far from being antithetical to feminists actually captures some of feminism s deepest ethical insights Homiak With regard to Descartes Margaret Atherton has argued that his concept of reason was interpreted in egalitarian rather than masculinist terms by several women philosophers of the eighteenth century and was used in their arguments for equal education for women Other feminists have urged the reconsideration of the views of canonical figures from Hume to Dewey For example Annette Baier has argued at length for the value of a Humean perspective in both epistemology and in ethics for feminist theory Baier And in Pragmatism and Feminism Charlene Seigfried argues for the value of pragmatism for feminism a position also taken by Richard Rorty Seigfried Rorty Feminists have used the strategy of appropriation with a wide range of philosophers including Hegel Mills Foucault Hekman Kierkegaard L on and Walsh and Derrida Holland It is interesting to note that some of the very same philosophers who were cast as the villains of the traditional canon are also mined by feminist theorists for useful ideas Indeed it is likely that every philosopher from Plato to Nietzsche who has been subject to feminist criticism also appears in some feminist s good books This is perplexing After all if feminists evaluate canonical texts so differently it raises questions about the coherence of feminist interpretations of texts Is Aristotle a feminist hero or villain Are Descartes ideas dangerous for feminists or useful to them If feminists have argued both positions we begin to suspect that there is no such thing as a feminist interpretation of a philosopher And this might lead us to wonder about the coherence and unity of the project of feminist canon revision Why is it that feminist philosophers have reached different and even sometimes incompatible interpretations of the history of philosophy One answer is that the multiple and contrary readings of the philosophical canon by feminists reflects the contested nature of the us of contemporary feminism The fact that feminist interpretations of canonical figures is diverse reflects and is a part of on going debates within feminism over its identity and self image Disagreements among feminist historians of philosophy over the value of canonical philosophers and the appropriate categories to use to interpret them are in the final analysis the result of debate within feminist philosophy over what feminism is and what is theoretical commitments should be and what its core values are Supplementary

The European Commission on Tuesday adopted its annual Enlargement Package which reaffirms that the momentum for enlargement stands high on the priority agenda of the European Union while the accession of new member states is increasingly within reach Our package provides specific recommendations to all our partners commission President Ursula von der Leyen said after the first of its kind televised live Enlargement Summit And to all of them we say EU accession is a unique offer A promise of peace prosperity and solidarity With the right reforms and a strong political will our partners can seize this opportunity Countries of Albania Bosnia and Herzegovina Georgia Montenegro North Macedonia Moldova Serbia Turkiye and Ukraine continue their respective paths toward the European Union The European Commission said it remains fully committed to supporting future member states in the journey toward membership and it could welcome new members as early as Ding Chun director of the Center for European Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai said The EU and its institutions want to use this opportunity to draw public attention and give candidate countries all at different stages of accession a chance to be seen Through this renewed spotlight the EU hopes to rekindle and strengthen both public and governmental interest in joining the Union he said At the same time EU institutions also see this as a way to expand their own influence namely to remind Europeans of the meaning of integration to reinforce a sense of unity and to revive the EU s centripetal force within member states Interests of members Ondrej Dostal a member of the European Parliament said Enlargement must serve not primarily the European Commission s agenda but instead the interests of each member state Dostal listed geopolitical confrontation as a poor reason for EU enlargement saying that if the candidates join the bloc the reason must be common peace and prosperity across the continent Enlargement is too important to rush we owe it to our citizens and to candidate countries to get it right I do not oppose closer collaboration with the neighboring countries he said A better alternative to full scale membership at least for the time being would be more intense market cooperation in the European Economic Area or a cooperation modeled on the example of EFTA European Free Trade Association Regarding the EU s future enlargement Ding said there are of course differing views among current members and such differences are natural However it is good practice for them to voice the differences out he said By livestreaming such a summit on European integration the EU is aiming above all to amplify its effects to address the democratic deficit and to boost public engagement and solidarity toward the European project
Theories of domination try to understand the value of justice freedom and equality by examining their absence Such theories seek to clarify and systematize our judgments about what it is to be vulnerable degraded or defenseless over against unrestrained power There is of course considerable disagreement about what domination really is Even so theorists of domination tend to agree about this much domination is a kind of unconstrained unjust power that enables agents or systems to define other agents or control the conditions of their actions We can call this the basic idea of domination The basic idea has the following components Domination is a kind of power and specifically social power that is power manifest in the sphere of interpersonal relations Domination typically involves imbalances or asymmetries in power The English domination comes from the Latin dominus A dominus is a master and mastery represents an extreme of social power So called masters usually have all but complete control over how the enslaved will act or over the conditions in which they act As a result the slaver enslaved relation is often treated as the most obvious case of domination In what follows I will avoid the language of masters and slaves given that it originally reflected the perspective of the former Domination has many forms Traditional Roman republicans recognized a distinction between imperium and dominium domination by the state contrasted with domination by private parties Pettit ff Being enslaved may be the clearest case of domination but literal enslavement is not necessary Tyrants over their subjects and men over women in patriarchal societies are also standard examples of domination Combined with slavery these examples are so common in the literature we can refer to them simply as the Paradigms Failing to explain why the Paradigms exemplify domination is sometimes considered reason enough to reject a theory of domination see Lovett Blunt and McCammon Other examples may not manifest the extremes of power we see in the Paradigms but it is generally recognized that domination comes in degrees and someone may be dominated even if nobody has total power over them Dominating power is in some sense unconstrained It is often described as arbitrary or discretionary or perhaps unlimited by the interests of those under its sway or perhaps projecting a worldview most favorable to the empowered while preventing the subjugated from seeing themselves or the world on their own terms However characterized the claim that domination involves the absence of control or limitation recurs in many theories Domination is an unjust or morally illegitimate form of social power Whatever domination turns out to be it is morally serious It is a complaint Pettit To be dominated is typically to have cause for indignation and resentment against the dominator or against institutions that dominate or make domination possible As we will see agreement that domination is morally wrong is not the same as agreement about whether the best conception of domination is moralized See section below It is more common for theorists of domination to assume than to explain its injustice This is probably because the Paradigms are also prime exemplars of unjust social relations Contemporary disagreement about domination often involves competing answers to three questions Who or what can dominate Does domination involve the mere existence of power with a certain structure or is domination an exercise of power Exercised or unexercised what kind of power is domination The remainder of this entry will address each of these questions and conclude with a survey of how the idea of domination features in recent applied ethical and political theory It will become clear as we examine various answers to these three questions that there are very different ideas of why exactly we need a theory of domination There may be wide agreement that we need a theory of domination to make sense of unjust power relations but unjust power relations are wildly varied and theorists of domination disagree not only about which varieties most need to be understood but about how theorizing domination helps us to understand them A word of qualification this entry is predominantly a survey of work from anglophone political philosophers and theorists broadly within the analytic tradition Recent literature on domination in this tradition was largely spawned by the republican revival a renewal of interest in the republican tradition associated with Quentin Skinner s historical scholarship and Philip Pettit s political theory This tradition treats domination as the primary political evil mostly by opposing it to freedom as the primary political good For more see the entry republicanism Hereafter I will refer to this movement as neorepublicanism Neorepublicanism emerged as a corrective to what Skinner and Pettit saw as inadequacies in common liberal theories of freedom centrally the theory of liberty as the absence of interference made famous by Isaiah Berlin s Two Concepts of Liberty See the entries on Isaiah Berlin and positive and negative liberty In quick summation neorepublicans object that freedom is compromised by the presence of someone who can interfere with our choices even if they choose not to do so in the way that a slaver can interfere with the lives of the enslaved even if he chooses to leave them alone This is roughly the neorepublican conception of domination having discretionary power to interfere with the choices of others should you choose to do so even if you do not so choose Given their initial foils neorepublicans began theorizing domination at considerable distance from continental theories and accepted many of the assumptions and priorities of th Century liberalism Increasingly however the separation of analytic and continental traditions is narrower in theories of domination than in other areas of contemporary philosophy It is not uncommon for recent writers to avail themselves of conceptual resources from both traditions Even so for better or for worse considerations of continental thought here are mostly limited to their encounters with the analytic literature For a more comprehensive treatment of continental theories of power and domination see feminist perspectives on power Neorepublicans tend to present domination as a relation between agents only agents can dominate or be dominated You cannot dominate or be dominated unless you have a general ability to act intentionally based on your beliefs and desires see Lovett But individual agents often dominate because of their membership in some larger group e g white people in Western racialized hierarchies men in patriarchy This is instructive An individual man who rejects patriarchy may still have unjust power over women because of what he is in a position to do even if he explicitly rejects and tries to undermine patriarchal institutions So group membership is a way someone might dominate without wanting to given that we are not always able to choose the social groups we belong to For a minority position that domination is fundamentally a relation between groups where any domination between individuals is parasitic on group membership see Wartenberg The question of domination by groups has produced significant recent controversy Neorepublicans emphasize what we just noted about well intentioned individual men within patriarchy domination is manifest in what agents are able to do not only in what they do Neorepublicans insist that the malignant power of benevolent or lazy slavers is housed in their capacity not their willingness to interfere Likewise avoiding interference in the actual world because others decide not to bother us is no evidence that we avoid domination We must also be protected from interference in possible worlds where others decide they would like very much to bother us This is sometimes called the robustness requirement for theories of domination It is perhaps the central insight of neorepublicanism Neorepublicans also claim that we may be dominated by groups of individuals who could not on their own dominate us This presents a problem Isn t it always possible for other people to gang up into dominating groups Does this mean we are always dominated Keith Dowding calls this the coalition problem For any individual i at any given time there is always a coalition of others j k l who could stop i from doing x If this possibility is domination domination is inevitable But if domination is inevitable a permanent part of social life for creatures like us it will not make sense to treat it as an injustice As we will see this kind of problem recurs We need to theorize domination so that it doesn t turn out to be an unavoidable part of social life and so not worth complaining about This is now often called the problem of cheap domination McCammon Lazar and G deke Pettit and List tried to avoid the coalition problem by clarifying what it takes to dominate as a group Dominating groups have group agency Pettit and List Take a typical professor in a typical classroom It is possible for students to stop the professor from teaching should they all choose to do so But this does not mean that a typical group of students dominates as a group agent They are instead just a collection of individual agents To be a group agent requires certain shared beliefs attitudes and intentions The students may all despise the professor or believe the professor should leave and never come back but they are not in a typical classroom organized together to act on these beliefs and feelings This is obviously different from a situation where students have agreed together to drive the professor from campus if they are given even one more unexpected quiz Because mere collections of people are not always organized to act together as a group agent we are not dominated by the mere possibility of people ganging up on us But Thomas Simpson noticed the neorepublican insistence that governments are dominating tyrannies unless their citizens have power to control them and that citizens have this power even when they are not organized together as a group agent according to Pettit and List s standards for group agency Simpson suggests we call citizens powerful enough to check their governments even without sufficient organization for group agency a team When protesters spill into the streets to oppose their governments they may not have agreed together to act on common beliefs desires and intentions But given some provoking event their wills converge and we see dramatic action as a team Simpson thinks the possibility of team agency gives us another variety of the coalition problem Aren t we inevitably dominated by possible teams Even if the aforementioned professor doesn t face an organized gang of students ready to proceed according to plan if provoked all professors face students who might spontaneously agree to chase them from campus If it s possible for students to form professor persecuting teams does this mean the domination of professors by students is inevitable after all Of course there is obviously a difference between whatever vulnerability the typical professor faces before a room of students and the vulnerability say of a homeless person being stared down by a room full of wealthy diners after he walked into a posh restaurant hoping to use the restroom His felt vulnerability is real and entirely reasonable Whatever mild vulnerability a typical professor feels may easily be transfigured into a wholesome sense of accountability But how do we specify the difference A handful of strategies are in play and we will encounter them more than once The mainstream neorepublican approach is to solve the problem in terms of what agents are able to do where any assessment of what we are able to do includes an accounting of the conditions for coordinated action with other agents While a typical classroom full of students could in some weak sense of could force the professor out unless there is a tradition or general understanding that such an attempt if initiated will be joined by other students the students are a merely possible team However much each student might want to it is irrational for a typical student to believe that others will join them if they rise and charge the lectern Professors need not take the possibility seriously and so are not dominated However a homeless person in a posh restaurant faces a latent team and latent teams have abilities suited to domination A latent team according to Lovett is a group of agents who for specific contextual reasons have already solved or else are immanently poised to solve the coordination problems standing in the way of joint intentional action Thus it is rational for patrons of a posh restaurant to expect other patrons and the restaurant staff to join them in expelling anyone rich people don t want to see This is because the patron is part of a latent team ready to become active That the patrons will become collectively active in this way is not something the typical homeless person can ignore If the difference between merely possible teams and latent teams concerns common mutual understanding between fellow members of social groups or the lack thereof the difference between possible teams and latent teams is entangled with questions about the structure and norms of the social world at large How is power manifest in the formation and constitution of social structures What can we count on people around us to regard as acceptable or unacceptable behavior An obvious difference between the professor and the homeless person is that the students probably believe they shouldn t interfere with the professor and the restaurant patrons probably believe someone should interfere with the homeless person To be a professor is to have at least nominal purchase on social status This is clearly not the case for the homeless How does potential domination by groups or teams relate to a social group s common attitudes toward who has status and who lacks it who commands respect and deference and who does not Also see Sandven Once we notice the relevance of social structures and social norms to questions about domination it s natural to wonder if structures and norms themselves dominate That agents alone can be dominated isn t disputed but do agents alone dominate whether as individuals groups or teams Neorepublicans like Pettit and Lovett are explicit to be dominated just is to stand in a certain relationship with some other agent Lovett and to be dominated is to have a master Lovett Pettit To be dominated according to what Lovett describes as the standard republican view is a condition of dependence on the will of a specific agent or agents effectively organized for group team agency Because of this insistence on a two way relation between specific agents or groups teams Rafeeq Hasan calls Pettit s and Lovett s theories dyadic Domination is a social complaint that is it is always a complaint against other people Like all animals we are vulnerable to bad weather and disease and other forms of mere misfortune regardless of how other humans treat us These vulnerabilities are not in themselves social ills though they are often made much worse by the social worlds we inhabit That is why we are not dominated by the weather or by disease except in a metaphorical way But this does not settle the question of whether domination requires the presence of a specific dominator That the social structures we inhabit with their constituent institutions laws norms ideologies et al have their particular shape is the contingent result of human activity unlike our natural vulnerabilities to weather and disease Are these social artifacts themselves ever the proper objects of domination complaints apart from the individuals they empower Most will agree that social artifacts like those just listed may be unjust and so the appropriate target of normative criticism Is the concept of domination useful here and perhaps even necessary Thinking of domination in terms of structures and systems rather than or in addition to particular agents emerged primarily as a critique of industrial capitalism The movement Alex Gourevitch calls labor republicanism saw domination not only in the servile condition of particular workers to particular bosses but in the very structure of capitalist society Because The land the tools and materials of labor are still the exclusive property of the privileged few wrote the author of the Journal of United Labor the worker cannot produce without giving himself a boss or master Gourevitch recommends we think of this as a kind of structural domination The labor republican critique generalizes as an argument for domination beyond the interpersonal Suppose I am not yet exposed to the power of a particular dominator but I live in a society structured so that I cannot rationally refuse to enter a social relationship where I will be dominated e g I cannot earn a living otherwise So I am not free to refuse such a relationship This lack of freedom cannot be explained by my vulnerability to a particular dominator given that no such particular social relationship now exists If this is correct the affront to my freedom is the social structures that force me to enter a social relationship with a particular dominator Hasan calls analogous cases to our attention where the issue isn t so much being forced to choose a master as being unable to escape social conditions in which you may be enslaved at any time see also Vrousalis Karl Marx s critiques of capitalism emerged alongside socialist republicanism and William Clare Roberts sees in them another theory of impersonal systemic domination essentially domination by market forces Speaking of markets in terms of power that they have force or are forces that it is possible to be exposed or vulnerable to such forces or be determined by them is familiar We might well wonder if they dominate For Marx on Roberts reading they are analogous to the interpersonal domination highlighted by neorepublicans When you are enslaved your deliberative capacity is radically constrained if not rendered completely inert by dependence on the will of a master Similarly Marx claims market forces make practical reasoning subject to the necessity of maximizing profits Whatever you think best to produce or the best use of your talents you must produce what is maximally profitable or be driven from the market by those who do Also the market no less than slavers or tyrants can be seen as closed to contestation Someone might contest within it by bringing better or less expensive products to market but this only reinforces and reproduces the market For criticism see Vrousalis and Louette A more concrete contemporary analog to traditional mastery without agential dominators may be the condition of warehousing and delivery workers under the management of algo rithm bosses Varoufakis In some factories management by human bosses has been replaced by algorithms empowered to assign workloads and penalize workers through the reduction of paid hours or even termination if their human charges do not meet the algorithms self generated standards of efficiency Workers in these conditions typically have no way to contest the decisions of their automated supervisors Varoufakis see also Blunt While the labor republican tradition with the Marxist themes Roberts highlights sees systemic domination primarily as an affront to freedom of choice and the conditions of action Dorothea G deke and Rafeeq Hasan tie domination conceptually to unequal standing before laws norms and social customs We may encounter dominating power through interactions with individuals G deke admits the possibility of interpersonal domination while Hasan claims individuals as such never dominate but domination is essentially authorized by a society s ascendant culture For G deke interpersonal power is domination only against a background of authorizing systems of belief and practice and these authorizing systems dominate even those who do not face interpersonal domination Even if a woman carefully avoids relationships that would put a specific man in a position to dominate her she moves through a social world that interprets who she is and what she must do without authorizing her voice If systems like patriarchy or slavery or apartheid are necessary for the existence of domination between agents and given that authorizing systems often perdure through the uncoordinated confirmation and reinforcement of many individuals it is tempting to think of such systems as impersonal domination For example it did not require intentional mass coordination for whites in the American south to maintain Jim Crow Ordinary white southerners maintained Jim Crow just being parents or teachers or salesmen or soldiers or priests ordinary decent people McCabe because it was in their perceived interests whether material or symbolic to do so Certainly the decision of an individual or an isolated group of individuals to treat me as an equal will not change how I am regarded by the social world at large The norm confirming and norm reinforcing activity of individuals according to theorists like G deke and Hasan is too diffuse to be group or team agency There are many examples of the way particular agents seem to be mere conduits of systemic domination Consider Vaclav Havel s grocer in Soviet era Czechoslovakia He posts slogans favorable to the regime in the window of his shop and so signals his cooperation with power while extending its reach Lovett Krause Blunt Sharon Krause offers the example of her mother s insistence that she take smaller more ladylike steps and overcome her natural stride Perhaps the ascendant patriarchal ideology her mother communicates and enforces is what dominates both mother and child see also Foucault Workers who have deeply imbibed the values of capitalism might be another example see Thompson and someone who accepts whatever meaningless work is available because their sense of self worth depends on not being a slacker The standard neorepublican rejoinder is that possible examples of domination by systems or ideologies through agents are better understood as instances of domination by agents through systems or ideologies Institutions systems and ideologies are sources of power that make domination possible rather than sites of domination The languages of sites vs sources is Blunt s See section below Hasan calls this the facilitation view social structures and systems facilitate domination but do not themselves dominate According to the facilitation view he claims domination will be conceptually independent of its social conditions Reduced to essences there would be no difference between a slaver or tyrant and a back alley bandit the slaver or tyrant forces you to do what they say by force of law and custom the bandit forces you to hand over your cash at gunpoint but in both cases there is uncontrolled power of choice interference by one means or another This kind of example has generated considerable churn in the recent literature as we will see One of the most persistent recent disagreements concerns whether or not domination requires the exercise of power As emphasized above neorepublicans link domination to what agents are in a position to do or have the capacity to do rather than what agents actually do The advantage of their account to liberals is supposed to be how neorepublicans highlight the threat of potential interference to freedom Domination says Lovett is in the structure rather than the outcomes of power Whether or not an employer can fire their employees at will is about how the employer employee relationship is structured whether or not an employer actually fires an employee or whether the employee manages not to starve because they have a job are outcomes of the relationship The emphasis on structures rather than outcomes draws our attention to the nature of power itself We do not stop objecting to paradigmatic dominators merely because they promise to make gentle and judicious use of their powers Emancipation requires that they cease to have their power So neorepublicans deny that self regulation by the powerful can even reduce domination Lovett At an extreme Pettit says that domination persists without external checks that remove or replace the interference option or put it cognitively off the menu and that domination is reduced only by exogenous forces The only internal forces sufficient to reduce domination must disable in the manner of deep seated neuroses Nothing else meets the robustness requirement That outcomes of power relations or the character of the empowered are not essentially relevant to domination faces two primary objections first that this fails to capture realities the dominated really object to second that this leads to significant over generalization No one denies that victims of power object to its outcomes and not merely to their initial vulnerability Certainly neorepublicans think both are objectionable But if we insist that domination properly refers only to the structure of power relations and not to outcomes of those relations we may have a difficult time explaining the standard use of domination to refer to overwhelming power wielded against the defenseless Suppose Columbus merely sailed around the margins of the New World without making landfall and that his power to exploit and destroy native cultures was never exercised Is this counterfactual history still a story of European domination If not shouldn t we identify European domination with actual harm inflicted on people who were not equipped to resist Katz Also victims of domination specifically object to the character of their dominators Christopher Lebron and Melvin Rogers highlight this Rogers especially insists that theories of domination influenced by neorepublicanism overplay the irrelevance of character to dominating power His recent work on black American republicans like Martin Delany Hosea Easton Maria W Stewart David Walker shows a contrasting emphasis on the comportment of white Americans Opposing race based systems of domination requires not just freedom from the arbitrary power of white Americans but a transformation of the system of cultural value in which blacks occupy a lower position of worth Rogers This is transformation not only of the external checks on domination achievable by legal reforms but a transformation of the hearts of white Americans Rogers argues that neorepublican theories are best suited to diagnose the evils of political slavery where the essential humanity of the enslaved is not necessarily questioned unlike chattel slavery which was constructed and maintained by ideological commitment to white supremacy and black inferiority External checks may be sufficient to counter political slavery they marshal society s coercive power to enforce the already acknowledged value of the enslaved but external sanctions alone while necessary cannot repair the systematic denial of this value Over generalization worries are the most common objection to neorepublican approaches to domination If domination is just the capacity for arbitrary interference and given that such capacities seem ubiquitous domination may be ordinary to the point of triviality Even sitting around minding their own business and coalition problems aside gentle giants Kramer and more ordinary varieties of the kindly and musclebound have the capacity to overpower weaker people even if they never do those with a natural gift for persuasion have the capacity to talk the gullible out of their savings Friedman Also if the primary function of the state is to minimize domination should neorepublicans get the state to hinder strength or persuasiveness That is unsavory An obvious fix is to insist that only actual or attempted arbitrary interference dominates Friedman For some feminists the over generalization worry is specifically that neorepublicans make relationships of care and dependency unreasonably suspect A caregiver who would not dream of harming their charges nevertheless has the capacity to infecting wounds instead of cleaning them throwing someone down the stairs instead of helping them up Friedman and Ferejohn Pettit acknowledges this feature of his theory when he claims that caring and uncaring parents alike dominate their children in a state of nature Pettit The alternative is to insist that though care providers may stand in a relationship of unequal power with a vulnerable dependent unless this power is abused it does not dominate Domination instead of mere power requires active violation of moral standards and or compromising the best interests of others Kittay The attractiveness of this alternate depends on how we understand powers or capacities If A has a power or capacity to interfere so long as it is possible in any sense for A to do so as Pettit sometimes suggests criticism focusing on the value of care is damaging Clearly it is physically possible for caregivers and parents to interfere with their dependents If however A does not have the power to interfere so long as appropriate penalties are in place for such interference the objection may not be very potent In other words it s not mere possibility that matters but social or legal possibility roughly what it is possible to do without risk of sanction from other members of your social group see List Valentini A hallmark of feminist ethics and political philosophy is insistence that power relations inside the home often manifest domination even though the home can be a center of loving care and dependence and that legal or social sanctioning of spousal child abuse reduces domination Costa Such laws of course do not make interference impossible simpliciter instead it makes interference risky and potentially costly In Lovett s language such sanctions help make caregivers who would harm their dependents ignorable See also Kirby Also shifting from domination as mere power to domination as abuse of power may lead to other unattractive results especially given broadly feminist commitments If domination requires actual or attempted interference women who avoid interference by seduction ingratiation or avoidance aren t dominated Costa This feature of neorepublican accounts the insistence that domination is the mere condition of being vulnerable may be exactly what makes the concept useful for feminist philosophy Laborde There are other proposed counterexamples to the claim that the capacity to interfere at will dominates Shapiro What about a playground bully who is able to beat up any of the smaller children but is widely known only to beat up black children Does the bully dominate the white children just as much as the black children What about someone like s American senator Joe McCarthy He had the same power to interfere in the lives of right wing and left wing Americans but citizens on the left had far more reason to fear him Perhaps the intuitive judgment here is that the bully only dominates the black children and that McCarthy only dominates left wing citizens Both examples are from Ian Shapiro The persuasiveness of these examples depends in part on whether we think domination is the sole political evil at least in the sense that all other political evils can be addressed most effectively by minimizing domination The black children and the left wing citizens in Shapiro s examples are obviously worse off than the white children right wing citizens If we diagnose their condition only by reference to domination Shapiro s examples are more damaging This is true even though there may not be much practical space between Shapiro s account of domination and Pettit s Shapiro too speaks of domination as a complaint against a power relationship and sees vulnerability to domination like domination itself as an injustice This is close to what Pettit calls virtual domination This controversy aside there is broad consensus that you can be dominated even if nobody is actively dominating you at the moment Even if there is no domination without an actual display of power over you or people like you at some time domination might persist when unexercised precisely because of its previous exercise As Wartenberg says the actual exercise of power can condition a social relationship in a longstanding manner If power has been exercised over you in the past or over someone like you perhaps because you are both members of a subordinated social group this will affect how you relate to those in power For example suppose you know that the boss can fire you at will He has not fired you or even threatened to do so and so has not actually exercised this power over you Even so you have seen him exercise this power over other employees As a result you do whatever you re told for fear of what the boss can do to you and has done to others If so domination might not require the active exercise of power against you but require the active exercise of power against someone relevantly like you Of course this leads to further questions e g How recent must active exercises of power be in order to condition ongoing social relationships where power is dormant Such questions have received relatively little attention thus far But see Hirschmann Does a Mugger Dominate Dorothea G deke asks It depends she says When we understand what it depends on we thereby solve the primary overgeneralization problems afflicting neorepublican theories of domination A mugger may have an uncontrolled power to interfere but that doesn t tell us all we need to know After all imagine that the mugger is someone just now escaped from slavery in the antebellum American south and the person mugged is an elderly slaver The former might be able to beat the latter to death if he doesn t hand over his money At least here and now he has an uncontrolled power to interfere Even so he is very plausibly the dominated and not the dominating power He may have what G deke calls an opportunistic capacity to interfere in this isolated encounter but he is marked as vulnerable by the social world and the slaver is not Marked how By social norms that allow him to be treated as chattel and a legal system that enforced property rights to human bodies obviously this is an incomplete accounting Even if he escapes the clutches of any particular slaver he is dominated given the failure of his social world to acknowledge and protect his equal status the failure manifest partially in Black Republican concerns with white comportment The question according to G deke of whether senators dominate leftists or bullies dominate black children or caregivers dominate their charges cannot be answered simply by reference to powers of choice interference The question instead involves background structures of normative permission standing and accountability As we have seen G deke and Hasan see these structures themselves as sites of domination apart from the ways they enable interpersonal power Neorepublican invocations of structure typically explain the costs and risks of interference The difference for G deke concerns what is structured What matters to the structure of domination isn t primarily what happen between individual agents their strategic relatedness opportunity sets etc Instead what matters is the sources of power in socially produced hierarchies that prestructure interactions in terms of unequal status G deke She emphasizes her continuity with a theme that always had a place if not pride of place in Pettit s neorepublicanism domination compromises equal status When you are dominated you face more than at will power to interfere with your choices you are deprived of the ability to command attention and respect and of standing among persons Pettit and so are not treated as a voice worth hearing and an ear worth addressing Pettit So should we think of domination first as a threat to an agent s choice situation and concern ourselves with that agent s status only as a reflection of their potentially dominated choices Or instead should we think of domination first as a threat to an agent s equal status and worry about dominated choices only insofar as they reflect diminished status The way we answer these questions about dominating social structure is directly relevant to recent discussions of mutual domination Neorepublicans used to assume if not always argue that domination requires inequalities of social power Andreas Schmidt challenged this orthodoxy Even if A and B are equally powerful both may have an uncontrolled power to interfere with the other s choices In a state of nature Schmidt says two gunslingers mutually dominate even if they are exactly matched as shootists Whoever gets the draw on the other can end their agency altogether the most dramatic choice interference imaginable It follows that if domination is a kind of uncontrolled capacity to interfere with choice two agents may equally possess this capacity and so mutually dominate If however the structure that matters to domination concerns the unequal distribution of respect status and normative authority in the social world equalized capacities for choice interference will be underdescribed for purposes of diagnosing domination just like mugger muggee dyads Schmidt s examples may represent a fissure between neorepublicanism and other attempts to theorize domination going forward Callum Zavos MacRae argues that the gunslingers display mutual arbitrary will dependence but not domination because dependence on an arbitrary will was never the correct analysis of the Paradigms The social ill characteristic of slavers patriarchs and tyrants was always an essentially egalitarian complaint a complaint against unequal status For an argument that Schmidt s examples involve unequal power after all see Bengston If domination concerns how social relationships are structured what is A in a position to do if A dominates B If domination requires the exercise of power how does A use their power when they dominate B If domination is essentially structural and systemic what kinds of structures and systems constitute domination Along one dimension we can sort answers to these questions into the moralized vs the non moralized For a moralized theory identifying domination requires us to settle more foundational questions about what is morally right or wrong just or unjust For example to claim that dominating power is the power to violate human rights makes our theory of domination depend on a theory of human rights obviously a moral theory Non moralized theories specify domination without reference to theories of the right or the good For example if we say that dominating power is power over the means of production our theory of domination will depend on a plausibly descriptive theory of what counts as control of the means of production We often make moral judgments involving non moralized terms I might claim that Plagiarism is always wrong and not necessarily claim that the correct conception of plagiarism is moralized When asked what plagiarism is I might say Plagiarism is the misrepresentation of someone else s academic work as your own or something along those lines Given that this conception of plagiarism does not itself include claims about what s right or wrong it is non moralized even if I also think plagiarism is always wrong Thanks to my colleague Sam Duncan for suggesting this example Of course those who define domination without making moral judgments aren t committed to what Ian Carter calls value independence about the phenomenon or the complete detachment of our analysis from all ethical concerns Contemporary discussion of domination from all comers is generally motivated by profound ethical concerns Sorting is also required along another dimension In addition to questions of moralization or non moralization there is the question of how domination relates to norms rules and supposed authority or to the use of power to dictate norms or claim authority Is domination always an attempt to rule Does domination always involve a claim however mistaken by dominators that their power is legitimate Does domination always involve demands that the dominated conform to norms Answering any of these questions in the affirmative is to advocate a norm dependent theory of domination Confusion is easy here given that moralized theories often appeal to norms and rules The difference between moralized theories and non moralized but norm dependent theories depends on the difference between correct moral norms rules as distinguished from the general social phenomenon of norms or rules Norm dependent theories say that domination always involves power exercised through norms and rules that some regard as legitimate perhaps the dominator perhaps the dominated or perhaps both As we will see for theories that are not just norm dependent but also moralized domination always involves a failure to respect the moral status of agents as sources of the norms that govern them For a merely norm dependent theory the domination of a patriarch might be essentially connected to the patriarch s claim that he deserves obedience from his family Obviously whether or not someone claims or doesn t claim to deserve obedience is a merely descriptive matter As a result such a theory is not moralized The legitimacy of the patriarch s authority is merely sociological not moral If a theory of domination says instead that the patriarch dominates because his demand for obedience unjustly undermines the right of his spouse and children to shape the norms that govern them that theory is both norm dependent and moralized A theory that depends in part on an account of unjust infringements is clearly moralized Sorting theories into these categories is complicated by the fact that whether a theory is moralized or norm dependent is sometimes a matter of active controversy This has particularly been true of Pettit s theory of domination In what follows sorting will reflect the intentions of the theorist at least as far as these intentions can be discerned Once we recognize the distinction between moralization and norm dependency we end up with four categories of answer to the question What kind of power is domination These are offered as types and necessarily elide specifics of different theories This section will examine theories from each division with their basic motivations and primary exemplars Neorepublicanism tends away from moralization and norm dependence If A has a great deal of power over B A will be well positioned to wrong B or to force B to act like A has authority but non moralized norm independent theories maintain that this is not essential to domination What is essential Roughly that A has an unchecked or uncontrolled power to impose their will on B to shape the framework of choices available to B so that B is highly likely to cooperate with A The disagreements among non moralized norm independent theorists are about the kind of checks or control that might prevent domination and about how imposition works Most non moralized norm independent theories follow in the wake of neorepublicanism and share its basic approach by theorizing domination in two movements first identifying a kind of power manifest in domination but also in non dominating social relationships then identifying the feature of domination that separates it from the power manifest in those non dominating relationships Usually the second movement describes the controls or checks present in non dominating social relationships and absent from the dominating ones These two movements will be treated in order below First what kind of social power is of interest to a theory of domination We have seen the way neorepublicans like Pettit and Lovett focus on the capacity to interfere with or frustrate an individual s choices Pettit uses the language of choice replacement removal and or misrepresentation A can interfere with B s choices by removing potential objects of choice running over B s bicycle and destroying it removes B s option ride my bike Knifing B s bike tire replaces B s option of riding their bike with another option riding it after the tire is repaired Removal and replacement are both objective forms of choice interference The misrepresentation of options is cognitive e g A tells B only idiots ride bikes If B is credulous and easily cowed A interferes with B s choices by misrepresenting them see Pettit This general emphasis on choice provokes the over generalization worries already discussed Shapiro Friedman Blunt McCammon Some choices clearly have more weight than others Obviously having no choice about where to sit in a caf doesn t matter compared to having no choice about where to live Connecting the former as well as the latter to dominating varieties of choice interference because both might represent the removal or replacement of an option cheapens the idea of domination If however we want to keep domination and the reduction of freedom conceptually connected there is reason to see domination in all power to interfere at least when that power is outside the control of the interferee But see Lazar Furthermore while Pettit analyzes domination in terms of choice interference his favorite heuristic focuses directly on dominated agents and the way they are social related to their dominators To be dominated for Pettit is to fail the eyeball test you cannot look others in the eye without reason for the fear or deference that a power of interference might inspire Lovett s early work on domination emphasized social relatedness as a precondition of domination A s social relatedness to B first of all seems to require strategic relatedness in the sense that what B is likely to do is a function in part of what A does To get from social relatedness to domination has other requirements At this stage of his work Lovett agreed that A could not dominate B unless is an asymmetry of power within their social relationship Further for A to have power over B plausibly requires that B cannot easily exit the relationship If someone can easily get a new job just as good as the one they have already their exit costs are low and they will have a correspondingly low dependence on the social relationship probably too low for domination to occur Lovett It may be that A s power over B and B s exit costs from their social relationship are not really separate conditions that A s power over B is a function of A s control of resources B cannot access except through A see Pansardi More recently Lovett favors the language of choice frustration and has also abandoned the requirement of unequal power between A and B in light of Schmidt s arguments for the possibility of mutual domination McCammon motivated primarily by the concern not to undermine domination s moral seriousness and to avoid problems of cheap domination shifts focus from choice interference toward forms of power suited to coercion Power enough to dominate as Scott Anderson says of coercion is suited to stop a person from pursuing her aims regardless of her motives or reasons McCammon calls this impositional power Power is impositional to the degree that it warrants confidence that the will of one agent can simply be replaced by the will of another This for McCammon is the kind of dependence on the will of another that should trouble neorepublicans Paradigm dominators wield such terrible power because they can attach costs to noncooperation higher than the costs of cooperation even if the costs of the latter are nigh unbearable For criticism see Lazar and G deke A capacity for choice interference or social relatedness however rendered or power suited to imposition is necessary but not sufficient for domination on a non moralized norm independent theory There are it is generally agreed benign forms of each The malignancy of domination comes from something more Neorepublicans first referred to this something more as the arbitrariness of dominating power and still do with some regularity but Pettit himself now favors the language of control or the absence of control This move emphasized the non moralized nature of his theory For criticism connected to this shift in Pettit s presentation see especially Christman Costa and McMahon The terminological shift was wise given the natural tendency to contrast arbitrary power with power backed by good reasons or power put to good purpose Arbitrary power for neorepublicans has never been merely unreasoned power Though Pettit earlier emphasized the connection between arbitrary power and power that fails to track the interests of those subject to it he measured interests by appeal to avowed or avowal ready interests not by an independent notion of the objectively good or reasonable The language of control also has echoes in his earlier work For example in Republicanism he says that an act is arbitrary by virtue of the controls or more precisely the lack of controls under which it materializes This shift toward domination as uncontrolled power follows Pettit s more recent attempts to contrast domination with well constructed democracy but the opposition of democratically constrained power and dominating power reflects his earlier insistence that we cannot know when power is arbitrary except by recourse to public discussion in which people may speak for themselves and for the groups to which they belong Here too he connects his own theory to Iris Young s account of domination in Justice and the Politics of Difference Young says that domination is the opposite of thorough social and political democracy and defines life within structures of domination as living under others who can determine without reciprocation the conditions of the dominated person s actions either directly or by virtue of the structural consequences of their actions For a non moralized theory identifying domination as anti democratic must involve a non moralized account of democracy This is not necessarily a problem because we can describe political institutions as democratic in a merely descriptive sense Someone who says The expansion of the franchise leads to a more democratic society might simply mean that a larger percentage of the population gets to vote and think that is a terrible idea and a reason not to expand the franchise More difficult is showing how even broadly democratic states are non dominating if we think the absence of domination involves literal control of the state by those it governs The vast majority of individual citizens do not control their state in any meaningful way Given the enormity of contemporary states it is unclear how they could We might say that they should rest content with a fair share of control or with a fair chance at control But this looks very much like a way of moralizing the theory since fairness is clearly a moral notion Pettit s primary attempt to explain non domination in terms of democratic political arrangements is contained in the final three chapters of On the People s Terms For more interpretation and criticism of Pettit s idea of control see Arnold Harris Mayer Schink Sharon Simpson and Kolodny For an argument that neorepublican statism is inconsistent with non domination see Kinna and Prichard In his earlier work Lovett argued that avoiding domination does not require democracy so long as the powerful are subject to public and reliably enforced rules Perhaps democracy does in fact most effectively reduce domination but this should follow from substantive argument not from the mere analysis of concepts Lovett Lovett offered the following case as evidence of how suitably publicized and enforced rules reduce domination even when they fail to express the will of the subordinated Suppose that for various historical economic and cultural reasons one group in some society manages to acquire a preponderance of social power which it wields over the other groups in that society directly and without constraint much to its own benefit Since the subordinate groups are in no position directly to challenge the preeminence of the powerful group they instead demand only that the various rights and privileges of the latter be written down codified and impartially enforced by independent judges In time let us suppose the powerful group accedes to this demand on the view that since the rules will be designed to benefit them after all there will be no significant cost in their doing so If power is organized and systematized in law it does sound odd to call it arbitrary After all it may be entirely predictable Here Lovett tacked closer to the commonsense idea that what is arbitrary is unreasoned or unfettered by rules At this stage he was willing to say that real world systems of domination like Jim Crow and South African apartheid might cease to be dominating in possible worlds where they managed strict adherence to explicit rules and procedures That such regimes would remain oppressive is obvious but this might be explained by other political evils than domination Instead of a substantive account of arbitrary power where power dominates when it isn t forced to track the will of those subject to it he recommends proceduralism power dominates because it isn t reliably constrained by effective rules procedures or goals that are common knowledge to all persons or groups concerned Lovett For more treatment of the debate between Pettit and Lovett about the nature of arbitrary power see the section on arbitrary power in the entry on republicanism Lovett s arguments for proceduralism have provoked several clarifications of what substantivism requires Proceduralism highlights what Gwilym David Blunt calls sources of domination that are personal as opposed to social and sites of domination that are interactional as opposed to systemic Sources of domination for Blunt concern the derivation of dominating power i e does A dominate B because of A s own stockpile of deadly weapons Does A dominate B because of A s place in a social hierarchy The former is a personal and the latter a social source of domination Sites concern the locus of domination i e does the domination occur between agents Between an agent and an institution The former is an interactional and the latter a systemic site of domination Widely known and reliably enforced checks on power of the kind emphasized by proceduralism really do reduce domination enabled by personal sources of power like A s possession of more guns or guile than B especially when this power is expressed in the interactions of A and B as individual agents If A and B are neighbors and A has a huge stockpile of weapons and B has none it makes sense to think of B s complaint against A as a matter of their intense vulnerability to power constrained only by A s whims Substantivism may be better equipped to recognize domination in what Blunt calls social sources and systemic sites In actual systems of domination A often has power over B not because A alone has more power e g by having more guns of their own but because A and B both live within a system intended to advantage A s group and disadvantage B s Often A has power to adjust the system or access to such power while B does not Of course if we think of power to adjust the system in terms of the system s norms or governing principles this will bring a theory of domination very close to norm dependence if not moralization There is another way to account for proceduralism s insistence that reliably enforced common knowledge rules reduce domination even without democratic constraints When A alone decides whether and how to harass B A s power to harass B is checked only by A s sense of what is best or what should be done Suppose A lives in a society that introduces a reliably enforced common knowledge rule that A can harass B only by putting B in the stocks but may not whip B This changes the situation both for A and B Now A alone does not decide whether and how to harass B now A is not checked simply by what A thinks they have reason to do In this way A s power is less deliberatively isolated McCammon Lovett s more recent work shares this emphasis Proceduralism about domination in Lovett s The Well Ordered Republic involves multiform ways of reducing how B s practical situation depends on what A does or doesn t do the idea is simply that any sort of public constraint on the ability of one person or group to frustrate the choices of another might count as suitable for the reduction of domination If this is right domination can be reduced even by non democratic reforms However laws and other limits on individual power may be formed by whole groups in a deliberatively isolated manner as under Jim Crow and apartheid if the members of A s group have input into the rules but the members of B s group do not Empowered groups often dictate the terms of their dealings with subordinated groups based only on their own sense of how things should be and the deliberatively isolated power of groups may be strengthened by measures that reduce the deliberative isolation of individuals As we will see norm dependent and moralized theories insist that this supposed normative authority is essential to domination Norm independent moralized theories of domination are less influential than non moralized varieties Even so their appeal is easy to see There is straightforward reason to moralize domination i e dominators use their power to do bad things So called masters sexually assault the enslaved Men within patriarchy sexually assault women Domination allows evil deeds go unpunished This impunity is perhaps what matters most to moralized theories Of course not every instance of wrongdoing manifests domination When a slaver tortures the enslaved this is domination but when the latter gets the drop on a slaver and tortures him it may not be even on the assumption that both cases of torture are wrong Why The difference is in what the slaver will face as a consequence for torturing the enslaved as opposed to what the enslaved will face for torturing the slaver The slaver wrongs the enslaved with impunity the enslaved wrongs the slaver only at grave risk from the enforcers of the system that enslaves her To get domination instead of wrongdoing it is necessary to include a requirement like this as a first pass A dominates B just because A can wrong B with impunity A will be well positioned to exercise control over B B will know that refusal to comply with A may result in violation of B s rights or interests A theory will be moralized but norm independent insofar as what explains the presence or absence of domination is the actual moral wrongness of power or its uses not its social endorsement or condemnation The latter has only incidental connection to actual right or wrong However the requirement that domination involve impunity will make the theory instable in the direction of norm dependence What a social world will punish what it endorses or condemns looks very much like a question of social legitimation The most common approaches to moralization without norm dependence couch domination in terms of violating basic or best interests Allen Lukes and Wartenberg are primary advocates of a basic interests approach Kittay Laborde and Shapiro share an emphasis on best interests Shapiro looks to local custom for guidance about the standard for legitimate power unless those customs dramatically undercut the interests of the less powerful For example he is happy to leave judgments of legitimate parental power to parents except for those who would deny their children education and healthcare The baseline is what is necessary to live as a normal adult in the context of contemporary democracies Laborde moralizes basic interests by appeal to what we have reason to value as opposed to what people might actually value A non moralized account of basic interests of course might connect interests to what people actually value regardless of what they have reason to value But this would leave us in the awkward position of being unable to recognize domination in the sufficiently brainwashed or propagandized Samuel Arnold and John Harris defend what they call interest substantivism this they say is Pettit s earliest and best conception of non arbitrary power Instead of non domination as essentially tied to the control of power or power exercised only in accord with a democratically accessed will of the people their substantivism tracks the interests of the public or what is good for us good for all of us as citizens The difficulty according to Lovett is that such accounts might collapse concern with domination into concern with the shape of the common good If we discern what the common good really is there is no place left for a specific worry about domination Now even having achieved an adequate understanding of the common good there is still the question of how best to secure it or to ensure that the use of power is robustly controlled so it always tracks this understanding Another standard objection is that what counts as the common good is intrinsically contested so the exercise of power in the name of the supposedly common good will inevitably be experienced by some as the imposition of someone else s will and so as dominating An alternative is to conceive of the common good as Victoria Costa recommends exclusively in opposition to actions that involve prima facie wrongness Perhaps domination only occurs when someone is in a position to worsen our choice situation in ways common sense regards as immoral If so we would need to assume that common sense about what is prima facie wrong perhaps here and now is not itself a manifestation of dominating power Certainly theories of domination from the Marxist or critical theoretic tradition will dispute this When we take a hard look at the most obvious cases of domination masters tyrants patriarchs we will probably notice they all claim authority The Paradigms all think of themselves as the ones who make the rules and that their subjects have an obligation to comply To say that domination as such always involves this kind of authority claim is a standard way to endorse a norm dependent theory A dominates B by having a kind of socially legitimate power over them Alternately as we have seen some theorists claim that we can be dominated by socially legitimized norms or practices themselves Not all social power operates through norms or doesn t seem to The neighborhood mob boss who comes by your shop demanding protection money almost certainly does not expect you to take his command Pay up or else as an expression of legitimate authority The typical mob boss cares only that you recognize him as a source of credible threats and comply According to most norm dependent theories this means the mob boss does not dominate Hasan for example is perfectly explicit about this Domination is always power under color of right The mob boss acts under no such colors he is one of G deke s muggers who fail to dominate The patriarch by contrast is empowered by his society to expect his commands to obligate those within his household and this not merely his power to interfere with choice is why he dominates Here norm dependent theories part company from their norm independent competitors the latter will tend to see both the mob boss and the patriarch as sources of domination As canvassed above norm dependence and moralization are separate issues We don t need a theory of the right or the good to tell us whether someone has power legitimized by local social norms or laws Of course we do need a moral theory to tell us if social norms or laws are right or just or truly legitimate As we will see in the next section the most influential norm dependent theories of domination tie it to a specific failure to respect the actual moral authority of the dominated and so offer a moralized as well as norm dependent theory Why prefer norm dependence to norm independence Often the move to norm dependence is motivated by familiar worries about over generalization I may have an uncontrolled power to interfere with your choices whenever I can take the last seat in a caf before you this obviously has nothing to do with any kind of authority over you The latter power seems less ubiquitous and more serious Also norm dependent non moralized conceptions are perhaps best equipped to diagnose domination where the dominated have internalized justifications for their status Neorepublicans often highlight how victims of domination don t have enough power to contest their position but what about cases where victims of domination are unwilling to contest because they accept a worldview that justifies their domination Michael Thompson calls such unwillingness a manifestation of constitutive domination the way norms institutions and values of the community shape the rationality of subjects to accept forms of power and social relations and collective goals as legitimate forms of authority In so doing he resists standard neorepublican talk of arbitrary power Domination is constitutive just because it is not regarded as arbitrary by those under its sway Instead he claims domination is the expression of widely rationalized and internalized norms Hasan even says that chattel slavery would have been an institution of mere force instead of domination had no one ever and in any way regarded slavers power as legitimate Certainly if we agree that all power necessarily involves legitimacy claims see Azmanova it makes sense to think that intense varieties of social power like domination will go hand in hand with thoroughgoing acceptance of legitimacy claims Thompson thinks neorepublicans are misled by their paradigms Neorepublicans get their touchstones of domination from slavery and traditional despotism varieties supposedly more prevalent in pre modern societies where the threat of violence was the primary currency of domination Instead he says we should see domination in the ideologies that make violence and coercion less necessary for example when the redistribution of public goods to private elites is widely accepted as natural or as the result of free exchange even by many who suffer as a result The internalization by the dominated of norms supposedly legitimizing their domination is not the only way to connect domination to internalized norms According to Christopher Lebron what is necessary isn t that the dominated accept a rationalization of their condition but that the dominators do so The difference between domination and more benign hierarchies he claims is that dominators control legitimizing myths that hide their domination The simple fact that a worker has a boss does not indicate domination it may instead indicate only a mutually beneficial arrangement Lebron A boss comes to dominate by accepting and promoting myths that justify their position What matters is that the dominating group imbibe such myths that their consciousness is shaped so that their power is mistaken for a feature of nature or a result of their innate merits or just deserts The norm dependent theories encountered so far look to institutions and systems to embody and promote social norms Regardless of whether institutions and systems themselves dominate standard norm dependent theories see the existence of institutions as a necessary condition for domination through norms e g the patriarch s power to project authority in his family depends on widely accepted attitudes about the place of fathers in the institution of the family Gwilym David Blunt s theory stands apart by being norm dependent without requiring background institutions According to Blunt even the mob boss has power over norms in the language introduced above this is an interactional site of domination drawn from a personal source i e power between agents drawn from the mob boss personal control of guns and muscle Unlike norm independent theorists such as Lovett Blunt claims that all social relationships involve norms Insofar as the mob boss and the shop owner are socially related this involves more than non normative elements like strategic relatedness or exit costs The asymmetry of power that matters is an asymmetry in the power to define the status of other parties in a social relationship The mob boss has power enough to assign the shop owner an inferior place in their social relationships and set up himself as the one who makes the rules in the relationship In this way Blunt believes he can preserve the standard neorepublican intuition that powerful agents like the mob boss can be dominators within a norm dependent framework We don t have to appeal to moral concepts to say whether a powerful person can or cannot dictate social norms but for an influential cluster of theories the norm dependence of domination is constructed in specifically moral terms This is an understandable move After all if we think domination is always expressed through norms and we think that domination is morally illegitimate even when socially legitimate it makes sense to think of domination as a specific failure to reckon with morally legitimate norms For theories of domination that are moralized as well as norm dependent we diagnose domination not just as power expressed through authority claims but as a specific kind of morally illegitimate authority G deke s more recent interventions canvassed in previous sections continue to develop themes in earlier moralized norm dependent theories particularly Rainer Forst s Forst and Henry Richardson worked either within or in direct response to neorepublicanism and offer a similar two movement approach to domination first giving an account of power manifest in domination but also in benign forms of power and second giving an account of what makes domination distinct and unjust For Richardson the broader category of benign or even legitimate power is the power to modify the rights and duties of others Dominators exercise an unauthorized variety of this normative power Richardson is motivated again by the desire to steer around what he thinks are neorepublican false positives criminals like the mob boss do not he claims dominate If an uncontrolled capacity to interfere with choice dominates we are dominated by the mere possibility that our neighbors will slash our tires in the night Secret tire slashing may be arbitrary choice interference but it serves no obvious role in wielding normative power Forst favors the language of reasons in identifying the broader category of power of which domination is a subset All social power he says is power within the space of reasons specifically justifying reasons This is why he calls his account of power noumenal power is not based merely on the control of material resources but instead on influence over what other agents see as justified thought or action That you have a lot of some material resource say money is irrelevant from the perspective of power unless you can use it to alter what others think they have most reason to do In general Forst says power is the capacity of A to motivate B to think or do something that B would otherwise not have thought or done It is clear enough that such power has innocent varieties when a teacher shows a student a new way to solve a math problem they motivate them to think and do in ways they would not otherwise Gentle persuasion between friends manifests the same power So both Richardson and Forst try to situate domination within a broader essentially normative phenomenon the power to place others under supposed duties or the power to affect what others regard as justified What then makes domination distinct and unjust For both Richardson and Forst domination involves a violation of our rights relative to the normative domain Dominators claim authority or power within the space of reasons that properly belongs to the dominated Domination is power unbound by the moral standing of its victims as co authors of the norms that bind them For Richardson who focuses specifically on power in the political context the arbitrariness of normative power manifests itself along several moralized dimensions dominating power fails to express fair deliberative processes among free and equal citizens that respect fundamental rights and liberties The slaver dominates because he takes for himself a power that belongs properly to the enslaved we have a moral right to decide together what our political rights and duties will be He is able to do this because his role as a master of slaves has institutional support If one of his slaves runs away he can call on the state to track the slave down and return them This is how real dominators are distinct from deluded claimants to normative power Imagine a mob boss who comes to believe that he speaks for God He might believe that he has a power to create rights and duties even so without social and legal backing analogous to what a tyrant or slaver or patriarch can depend on the mob boss will not succeed even in creating illegitimate rights and duties and so will fail to dominate on a theory like Richardson s For more argument expounding a conceptual connection between non domination and rights see Layman and Pala Similarly Forst measures dominating power against an explicitly moralized baseline power dominates to the extent that it is exercised outside a structure of democratic institutions designed to secure and respect the equal authority of each citizen to offer and receive adequate justifications Forst Noumenal power within social relationships becomes domination when agents within that relationship are denied their right to justification i e their right to participate as free equals in the space of reasons Interestingly Forst s theory like Blunt s non moralized theory and unlike Richardson s and G deke s apparently allows for domination outside official structures of authority Dominators Forst says seal off the space of reasons by denying our right to receive and offer adequate justifications but there are many ways to do this One way is simply through the threat of violence If a mob boss has all the guns and muscle he will be able to crowd the shop owner completely out of the justificatory space What the shop owner might believe about what they have reason to think and do is irrelevant given the price they will pay for non compliance Again if we understand the power required for domination as a kind of authority it makes sense to diagnose the presence or absence of domination in terms of illicit authority When illicit normative authority counts as such because it is claimed by a powerful few we are pushed firmly in the direction of a reckoning with the normative authority of all Of course once this reckoning has begun it is natural to diagnose domination in broadly Kantian terms as the absence of institutions securing respect for our autonomy See Bohman for a similar approach applied to international relations Norm dependent or moralized theories identify domination with some varieties of unrestrained asymmetric power and not others whether it be power to dictate the norms of a social relationship to establish legitimizing narratives to alter the shape of our supposed rights and duties to close us off from the space of reasons to violate our basic interests or to do us wrong This makes them more vulnerable to the possibility that domination can take some form not captured by any of these specific powers Lovett worries that moralized or norm dependent theories tend toward a kind of historical or cultural myopia seeing domination only in whatever forms of social power happen to be the predominant instruments of domination here and now or in time gone by He recommends we see some of the powers highlighted by moralized or norm dependent theories as varieties of domination but remain alert to other forms it might assume Of course devotees of moralization or norm dependency may respond that the leading non moralized norm independent contenders see domination where there is none fail to see its specific threat or cry domination where some other social evil is really the problem Because power asymmetries persist in other contexts outside the traditionally political the idea of domination has been marshaled beyond political philosophy in applied ethics and political theory even recently in philosophical theology See Alimi Opposition to domination has ecumenical appeal Few deny that the paradigms are examples of injustice so to show that some power structure or use of power resembles these paradigms goes a long way toward motivating a verdict against them Awareness of domination also draws our attention to the ways moral wrong can be manifest outside the limits of individual actions Aside from questions about which individual actions are wrong other questions become important Who is empowered to act in what ways How are potential victims empowered to resist Who is vulnerable even if not actually victimized However benevolent or malign who makes the rules Who obeys or refuses to obey and what does their compliance or refusal cost them How do the actions of those with more power construct the space where the less powerful or the powerless must act Medical care or the failure to provide it is rife with potential for domination The sick are vulnerable to those who control what they need to get well O Shea The disabled choose and act in a world constructed almost entirely for the benefit of and controlled by others De Wispelaere Casassas Workers often have little say in the conditions or culture of their workplaces Gourevitch Breen Anderson Migrant and immigrant populations often exist in political limbo where they are deeply vulnerable to exploitation and have no legal standing to contest their treatment Honohan Costa Sager The consumption habits of wealthy nations shape a global environment in which all humans now and for the foreseeable future will make their choices Bohman Nolt Smith Smith Katz The Internet as a digital space of equality and freedom is now a bygone dream of a halcyon age Hoeksema and Oldenbourg adopt and adapt conceptions of domination to theorize this loss That workers often have little say in the conditions or culture of their workplaces Anderson is obvious Power relations under contemporary capitalism continues to be one of the most active areas of the current investigation both of what domination is and how to oppose it In this way neorepublican inflected theory carries on the preoccupations of earlier socialist republicans Gourevitch Breen Gilabert Jenkins Bryan Herranz This has birthed important developments of the relation between domination and other political evils like exploitation Vrousalis Most deployment of anti domination arguments applies neorepublican theories of domination but there are important exceptions In addition to the departures from neorepublican accounts noted above in Friedman s and Kittay s work on caregivers and families other attempts to use domination beyond the traditionally political have yielded revisionary results For example Tom O Shea worries that the standard neorepublican focus on choice interference and the worsening of an agent s choice situation leaves us ill equipped to see the possibility for assistive arbitrary power in medical care In these cases the sick may be vulnerable to domination not because someone acts intentionally to interfere with their choices e g by raising the price of a drug beyond what they can afford but by failing to provide a benefit as when no one will provide transportation to someone with impaired mobility Bernd Hoeksema argues that understanding domination in digital space pushes us toward structural as opposed to agential and individualistic conceptions In a more dramatic departure Corey Katz argues that the tendency of mainstream neorepublicanism to ground domination in social relatedness and the possibility for choice interference makes it unfit to diagnose the domination of those yet to be born If we want to think of intergenerational injustice as a variety of domination Katz insists we must shift to an outcome based conception that focuses on unjust harm done to future generations who are unable to resist that harm Nothing is less surprising than persistent disagreement in philosophy but the persistence of disagreement about domination is connected to an interesting question about where the discussion should go from here What do we want a theory of domination to do Is our theory of domination supposed to tell us when people are free and when they are not To specify the requirements of truly egalitarian social relations Do we want our theory of domination to give us insight into the nature of social injustice To diagnose political misrule To motivate a theory of democracy To describe the underclass in late capitalist societies To capture the complaint of racial minorities in oppressive racialized hierarchies All of the above All theories of domination are not equally suited to each of these tasks as a consequence the appeal of individual theories may differ according to which we find most pressing A related question at present under explored in the literature is how domination does or does not relate to other concepts often used to describe power related injustices for example oppression and subjugation Young distinguishes between domination and oppression identifying the former with asymmetric power over action and the contexts of action and the latter with the more diffuse and sometimes unconscious shaping of institutions in ways that deny some social groups the capacity to understand and express themselves except from the perspective of the privileged Unfortunately few have followed her in working out a similar division of labor between these concepts For an interesting exception see Bellamy More common is the neorepublican assumption that concern for injustices like oppression can be folded into concern for domination Pettit Lovett Just as all theories of domination are not equally suited to every task we might put them to it may be that attention to domination itself should be supplemented by attention to other varieties of injustice If nothing else recent work on domination has dramatically sharpened our understanding of such injustice even if all its varieties cannot usefully be diagnosed as manifestations of this single ill In conclusion the attempt to theorize power and domination without recourse to debates primarily conducted among continental theorists risks redundancy We noted at the beginning of this essay how the analytic and continental traditions are nearer in the domination literature than in many areas of philosophy Increasingly this nearness is achieving actual interconnection This is salutary Please contact the author with suggestions Berlin Isaiah feminist philosophy

Ideas are among the most important items in Descartes philosophy They serve to unify his ontology and epistemology As he says in a letter to Guillaume Gibieuf dated January I am certain that I can have no knowledge of what is outside me except by means of the ideas I have within me Descartes never published anything that specifically worked out a theory of ideas Even so he said enough in published and unpublished work as well as in correspondence that allows for a basic reconstruction of a theory This entry will focus principally on the theory of ideas and how it relates to Descartes ontology though in Section of this entry which includes discussion of simple natures and Descartes concepts of clarity and distinctness certain components of his epistemology are briefly considered For more on the epistemology see the related entry Descartes Ren epistemology According to Descartes ontology there are substances attributes and modes These are understood relative to one another in terms of ontological dependence Modes depend on attributes and attributes depend on substances The dependence relation is transitive thus modes depend ultimately on substances No substances no modes In Principles Part I Article Descartes says that a mode presupposes an attribute AT VIIIA CSM I and in Article he says that an attribute presupposes an existing substance A mode of some thing was understood by Descartes as a a way of being that thing So where X is some substance a mode M is a way of being X That said in Article he also says that a substance minus its attributes cannot be known to the human mind Attributes are in fact what make existing substances intelligible to the human mind He reaffirms this in Article where he says that there is only a distinction in reason between an attribute and an existing substance AT VIIIA CSM I This strongly suggests that although one may draw a conceptual distinction between an attribute and existing substance the two are not distinct in reality They are really one and the same thing Nolan Hoffman Subsequently if mode M is a way of being X where X is the substance the intelligibility of X requires that we conceive some attribute A And so strictly speaking mode M is understood as a mode of attribute A where A is the attribute through which the existing substance X is conceived where in reality A and X are presumably identical The nature of a mind Descartes says is to think If a thing does not think it is not a mind In terms of his ontology the mind is an existing finite substance and thought or thinking is its attribute Insofar as the nature of a mind is to think where thought is the mind s defining feature Descartes calls it the mind s principal attribute AT VIIIA CSM I An idea is a mode of thinking In being a mode of thinking an idea is understood as a way of being an instance of thinking or an idea is way in which an instance of thinking is manifested This is similar to what Descartes says about a body its principal attribute and its modes The nature of a body is to be extended in length breadth and depth A body is a finite substance and extension is its attribute Since extension is the defining feature of a body Descartes refers to it as a body s principal attribute Shape is a mode of extension What this means is that shape is a way of being extended or a way in which an instance of extension is manifested Thus shape is to extension as idea is to thought Thus a shape presupposes extension and an idea presupposes thinking where each principal attribute presupposes an existing substance Insofar as ideas are modes they occupy the lowest rung on Descartes ontological ladder This can be contrasted to Plato s theory for example which casts ideas as substances occupying the upper most rung of the ontological ladder So whereas for Plato ideas are the most real things in the cosmos for Descartes ideas are among the least real Another departure from Plato s view was Descartes taking ideas as the vehicles of representation as the items doing the representing By contrast Plato took ideas to be the things represented Socrates for instance was taken by Plato to be a representation of the form or idea of man These differences are certainly enough to suggest that ideas are playing significantly different roles in their respective systems So it would not be reasonable to think that Descartes view was simply an extension of Plato s despite the fact that Descartes had adopted some of Plato s terminology Ideas are not the only modes of thinking Doubting and judging for example are also modes of thinking Early in the Third Meditation Descartes works out a basic division of the various modes of thinking He sorts them into two kinds simple and complex Ideas are included in the category of simple modes Doubting judging and the like are included in the category of complex modes Even so all complex modes include ideas as constituents A complex mode of thought includes at least two basic mental components an idea and some additional mental feature He writes In this passage ideas are cast as modes of thinking that represent or present or exhibit objects to the mind objects such as a man or Pegasus or the sky or an angel or God and given what Descartes says in the First Meditation among the list of things exhibited to the mind by way of its ideas one could add colors sounds feels and so on AT VII CSM II On Descartes view an idea is the only kind of simple mode that does this When considering one of the more complex modes of thought for instance fearing a lion or affirming the Pythagorean Theorem where the lion and the theorem are the objects presented it is the idea that is doing the presenting it is the vehicle of representation As Descartes will note in the Fourth Meditation he takes there to be two basic faculties capacities or abilities of the mind the intellect or understanding and the will Ideas are produced by the intellect So the idea of the Pythagorean Theorem has its origin in the faculty of the intellect or understanding The act of affirming the other component of the more complex thought of affirming this theorem has its origin in the faculty of the will Contributions from both faculties then give rise to the more complex kinds of thought Descartes is careful to not identify ideas as pictures or as visual images but instead says that they are as it were tanquam images of things This is a long standing theme for we find it expressed as early as The World AT XI CSM I and the Optics AT VI CSM I and as late as the Principles AT VIIIA CSM I and Description of the Human Body AT XI CSM I where in these contexts ideas are cast as representing their objects without necessarily resembling them This is important to the theory since the idea of cold or the idea of sweet for example insofar as they are ideas represent something to the mind but they are not visual images The point holds for other ideas such as the idea of God which Descartes explicitly lists in the above passage The idea of God represents something to the mind it represents an infinite substance and in line with traditional theological doctrine supposing that God is non spatial and non temporal the idea cannot be understood as being a visual image of God Consistent with what he says in the above Third Meditation passage Descartes says in other places that an idea is the form of any given thought immediate perception of which makes me aware of the thought AT VII CSM II In his reply to Thomas Hobbes author of the Third Set of Objections Descartes says that an idea is whatever is immediately perceived by the mind AT VII CSM II In his reply to Pierre Gassendi author of the Fifth Set of Objections he says that the term idea is extended to cover any object of thought AT VII CSM II In a letter to Marin Mersenne dated July he says that idea denotes in general everything which is in our mind when we conceive something no matter how we conceive it AT III CSMK III Long standing interpretations take such passages as telling us that ideas have the special feature of intentionality they are directed at their respective objects It is in terms of this directedness that the mind is said to be aware of an object One long standing interpretation the Representationalist interpretation says that for Descartes the objects immediately presented to the mind by way of an idea are purely mental objects This interpretation emphasizes Descartes saying that such objects are solely in the intellect as when he says to Caterus that the object of which the mind is immediately or directly aware when having the idea of the Sun is not an actual entity that is it is not a being located outside the intellect AT VII CSM II The object at which the mind is directed the immediate object of awareness is not the Sun itself but is instead a purely mental object which represents or stands for the Sun in the heavens This purely mental object is said to constitute the content of the idea On this view an idea is sometimes referred to as a tertium quid a third thing which stands between the mind s eye so to speak and the object that the idea represents Another long standing interpretation the Direct Realist interpretation says that for Descartes the objects immediately represented or presented to the mind by way of an idea are not always mental objects Nadler The idea of the Sun is understood as being a mental operation a mode of the mind directed at the Sun itself In fact on this interpretation all ideas are properly speaking to be understood as operations or acts of the mind This holds even for the idea of Pegasus The idea is a mental operation and in this case is directed at the mentally fabricated object Pegasus Here Pegasus is a purely mental object By contrast the sensory idea of the Sun is directed at the Sun itself the Sun in the heavens Thus this interpretation allows ideas to be directed at mental and extra mental objects The import of this interpretation is that the immediate objects of awareness need not be purely mental so no tertium quid which differs dramatically from the Representationalist interpretation Although both readings have their merits the remainder of this entry will work within the framework of the Representationalist reading When speaking of an existent mode in this case an actually occurring idea Descartes will say that it possesses formal reality The formal reality of a thing is the kind of reality the thing possesses in virtue of its being an actual or an existent thing AT VII CSM II For example given that the Sun is an actual or existent thing it possesses formal reality By contrast given that Pegasus is not an actual or existent thing he does not possess formal reality Given that the idea of the Sun or the idea of Pegasus are actual or existent ideas where an idea is actual or existent when it is being actively thought by a mind each would possess formal reality Descartes took there to be three levels of formal reality the level of infinite substance the level of finite substance as defined by its principal attribute and the level of mode The level of formal reality of an infinite substance is greater than that of a finite substance and the level of formal reality of a finite substance is greater than that of a mode This is understood in terms of ontological dependence A mode depends for its formal reality on the formal reality of a finite substance and a finite substance depends for its formal reality on the formal reality of an infinite substance An existent idea in possessing the level of formal reality of a mode is less real than a finite substance which is in line with what was said in the previous section of this entry When speaking of ideas as representing things to the mind Descartes will refer to an idea s objective reality The objective reality of a thing is the kind of reality a thing possesses in virtue of its being a representation of something ibid Given that the idea of the Sun and the idea of Pegasus represent things to the mind they represent or exhibit the Sun and Pegasus respectively each possesses objective reality Descartes says that ideas possess objective reality by their very nature Equally importantly ideas are the only items in his ontology that possess both formal and objective reality AT VII CSM II As with formal reality there are three levels of objective reality Descartes says Undoubtedly the ideas which represent substances to me amount to something more and so to speak contain within themselves more objective reality than the ideas which merely represent modes or accidents AT VII CSM II And Descartes Third Meditation examination of his idea of God reveals that the objective reality that it contains or possesses is that associated with an infinite substance At the very least the view is that the idea of God contains a level of objective reality that is greater than that contained in an idea representing a finite substance Thus the levels of objective reality possessed by ideas the reality they possess in virtue of their representing things to the mind are nominally three infinite substance finite substance and mode The categories of the objective reality hierarchy then correspond to those of the formal reality hierarchy The nature of an idea Descartes says is such that of itself it requires no formal reality except what it derives from my thought of which it is a mode AT VII CSM II In fact In so far as the ideas are considered simply as modes of thought there is no recognizable inequality among them they all appear to come from within me in the same fashion AT VII CSM II Each idea is simply a mode of thought and insofar as an idea is an existent or actual mode it possesses a level of formal reality of that of a mode He continues But in so far as different ideas are considered as images which represent different things it is clear that they differ widely AT VII CSM II The differences will not only be in terms of the objects represented but as noted above ideas will differ with respect to the levels of objective reality they contain AT VII CSM II To see the formal objective reality distinction at work within the context of Descartes theory consider an idea that has been mentioned several times already the idea of God as introduced in the Third Meditation Descartes analysis of this idea begins with his focusing on the fact that the idea represents to him an infinite substance AT VII CSM II The formal objective reality distinction suggests the following When considered simply as an existent mode of Descartes mind which is to consider it in terms of its formal reality Descartes sees no trouble in accounting for the origin of the formal reality of this idea the formal reality possessed by this idea is derived from the formal reality of his mind In other words the existence of the idea as mode depends on the existence of his mind But when considered in terms of what this idea represents or presents to the mind which is to consider the idea in terms of its objective reality Descartes discovers a problem which can be formulated what is the origin of the idea s objective reality This challenge arises in light of Descartes saying The challenge in the examination of the idea of God is to account for the origin of the idea s level of objective reality He determines that the formal reality possessed by his own mind cannot be its origin He concludes that there must be some being that in fact possesses the requisite level of formal reality which in this case will be greater than that of a finite substance For more see the SEP entry on Descartes epistemology Notice how this differs from what he says about the formal reality of an idea namely that his mind is the cause or origin of an idea s formal reality The examination of the idea of God follows almost directly upon the introduction of the possible connection between the objective reality of some of his ideas and the formal reality of extra ideational or extra mental objects Descartes analysis of the idea of God suggests a principle of representation which is discussed in Section of this entry There is a second distinction that Descartes introduces worth noting the material objective distinction Some scholars believe that it is simply an alternate way of expressing the formal objective reality distinction The material objective distinction is never clearly formulated in the body of the Meditations though Descartes employs it in his reply to Antoine Arnauld in the Fourth Set of Replies Descartes introduces the material objective distinction in the Preface To the Reader of the Meditations which was very likely written after the Meditations and the Objections and Replies He says that the word idea is philosophically ambiguous The term idea can be used to refer to a specific kind of act or operation of the mind here it is the act of representing In this sense the idea is simply an existent mode of the mind In light of the formal objective reality distinction since the formal reality of an idea a mode is derived from the formal reality of the mind its substance it follows that its level of formal reality cannot be greater than that of the mind This is what Descartes means when claiming that his ideas understood as operations of his mind cannot be more perfect than his mind When using idea to refer to an operation of the mind idea is expressing what he calls the material sense Sometimes he will say as he does in the above quoted passage that when understanding an idea to be an operation of the mind that it is taken materially Alternatively the term idea can be used to refer to that which is presented or exhibited directly to the mind by way of the mental operation When using idea to refer the object exhibited directly to the mind idea is expressing what he calls the objective sense Sometimes he will say as he does in the above quoted passage that when understanding an idea as the object immediately presented to the mind by way of a mental operation the idea is taken objectively Consider again the idea of God When taking this idea materially the idea is understood as an operation of the mind When taking this very same idea objectively the idea is understood as that which is presented directly to the mind by way of this operation The nature of the object presented Descartes says can be more perfect than his mind So even though he is not an infinite being an idea can nevertheless present to him a being that is infinite a being that possesses a greater level of reality than that possessed by a finite substance Again the emphasis is that such is possible only if the cause of the objective being possesses the requisite level of formal reality which in this case as just noted must be greater than that of a finite substance Where the two distinctions may differ is with respect to how Descartes employs them When tracing out the origins of the formal and objective reality possessed by an idea Descartes employs the formal objective reality distinction In some cases as in the case of the idea of God the origin of the formal reality of the idea is his own mind whereas the origin of the objective reality is God something that exists independently of his mind However when Descartes is speaking about the relation between an idea understood as a mental operation and this very same idea now understood as the object presented by way of this operation Descartes employs the material objective distinction The difference is with respect to the number of relations in play in the analysis Consider again the idea of God Concerning the formal objective reality distinction the number of relations is two the relation between the idea as mode and the mind and the relation between the object presented in or by the idea and God Concerning the material objective distinction there is only one relation being considered the relation between the idea as mental operation and this idea as object presented via this operation In the Meditations after Descartes casts ideas as modes that represent or exhibit objects to the mind he divides ideas into kinds He says Here Descartes considers three kinds of idea innate ideas adventitious ideas and what are sometimes called factitious ideas The categories are determined by considering the possible origins of the ideational contents presented or exhibited to the mind The first category includes ideas whose contents have their origin in his nature qua thinking thing An example is his idea of what thought or thinking is The third category includes ideas whose contents have their origin in the contents of other ideas An example would be the idea of Pegasus where its content is drawn perhaps from the contents of the idea of a horse and the idea of a bird Adventitious ideas however appear at least at first glance to be importantly different since Nature has always taught him he says to think that they are derived from things existing outside me AT VII CSM II The category arises in part from ordinary pre philosophical experience I know by experience that these ideas do not depend on my will and hence that they do not depend simply on me Frequently I notice them even when I do not want to now for example I feel the heat whether I want to or not and this is why I think that this sensation or idea of heat comes to me from something other than myself namely the heat of the fire by which I am sitting AT VII CSM II An account of their origin he suggests may require an appeal to things that exist external to or independently of his mind Adventitious ideas include sensory ideas ideas that originate in sensory experience such as the ideas of the Sun or the Moon but also the more simple ideas of colors sounds heat cold and the like In Descartes analysis of his idea of God he discovers that it is innate since it is neither adventitious nor factitious It is not adventitious or sensory since he has had no sensory experiences of God i e he has never seen heard felt smelt or tasted God This would be in line with the theological demand that God is immaterial It is not factitious for its content is something that his mind cannot fabricate from other ideas the idea represents an actual infinity at best his mind can only produce the factitious idea of a potential infinity AT VII CSM II Even so it becomes clear to him that the innate idea of God is like the adventitious idea of the Sun but unlike the innate idea of what thought is which has its origin in his own nature since like the adventitious idea of the Sun the objective reality possessed by the idea has its origin in the formal reality belonging to something other than his own mind His analysis concludes that the origin of the objective reality must be in an existing God an actual infinite substance something possessing an infinite level of formal reality In the Sixth Meditation he will ultimately conclude that the objective reality of his idea of body also innate must have like the innate idea of God its origin in the formal reality belonging to something other than his own mind namely it will have its origin in an existing corporeal substance an extended being that possesses a finite level of formal reality Ultimately the objective reality i e contents of his innate ideas and adventitious ideas must have their origin in the formal reality of things some of the latter being things existing independently of his mind This is not the only place in Descartes work where innate and adventitious ideas are cast as sharing the trait of having their respective origins in things existing independently of his mind For instance in Comments on a Certain Broadsheet published in Descartes casts innateness as a faculty AT VIIIB CSM I which aligns with what he had said to Hobbes in the Third Set of Replies when we say that an idea is innate in us we do not mean that it is always there before us This would mean that no idea was innate We simply mean that we have within ourselves the faculty of summoning up the idea AT VII CSM II Scholars note that this may be different from the way in which innate ideas were cast in the Third Meditation But in the sense of innate as faculty in Comments on a Certain Broadsheet Descartes goes on to say that there is a sense in which even sensory ideas ideas of qualities such as pains colors sounds and so on ideas arising via the senses which are a species of adventitious idea are nevertheless innate The argument unfolds as follows Given that the human or embodied mind has the faculty or capacity to have sensory ideas of pains colors sounds and so on where these are occasioned on the occurrence or presence of certain motions in the brain and nothing of the motions in the brain is transferred to the mind and nothing resembling the pains colors and sounds is present in bodies including the brain then the ideas of pains colors and sounds i e the ideas of those qualities must be all the more innate AT VIIIB CSM I One interpretation that has relatively recently emerged addresses the concern over the alleged similarity between innate and adventitious ideas by emphasizing the role that innate ideas play Nolan Lennon Nelson De Rosa Consider for example the adventitious or sensory idea of the Sun This idea presents the Sun to the mind as a shaped thing An analysis of this idea reveals that the innate idea of extension body is in play for without it the human mind simply could not experience or even conceive the Sun as shaped Shape presupposes extension As Descartes puts it in the Principles everything which can be attributed to body presupposes extension and is merely a mode of an extended thing which according to Descartes is aligned with the view that shape is unintelligible except in an extended thing AT VIIIA CSM I In this sense insofar as a shaped thing is made intelligible to a human mind the innate idea of extension is involved As some scholars have put it the innate idea underlies or informs the occurring idea of the Sun Nolan Nelson De Rosa This interpretation finds further support in what Descartes says in a letter to Princess Elisabeth dated May where Descartes introduces what he calls the primitive notions These are what in other contexts he calls the innate ideas In the letter he claims that these ideas serve as the patterns on the basis of which we form all our other conceptions AT III CSMK III So it is the unique role of the innate ideas that distinguishes them from adventitious ideas where their role is to serve as that which makes other things intelligible Scholars agree that Descartes recognizes at least three innate ideas the idea of God the idea of finite mind and the idea of indefinite body In the letter to Elisabeth he includes a fourth the idea of the union of mind and body There is an alternate division of ideas worth noting In the Third Meditation after having introduced the tripartite division of innate adventitious and factitious ideas Descartes continues to entertain the possible origins of the contents of his ideas His analysis turns on the principle that an effect can never be greater than its cause which is underwritten by the self evident principle that something cannot come from nothing He says And although one idea may perhaps originate from another there cannot be an infinite regress here eventually one must reach a primary idea the cause of which will be like an archetype which contains formally and in fact all the reality or perfection which is present only objectively or representatively in the idea AT VII CSM II Here Descartes introduces the notion of a primary idea The import of this notion is that the contents of some of his ideas may have their origin in things located outside his mind that is in things that exist independently of his mind Descartes analysis suggests that the contents of some of his innate ideas and all of his adventitious ideas have their origin in things existing independently of his mind Such ideas are included in the category of Primary Idea The innate idea of God is a primary idea since the objective reality it possesses has its origin the formal reality of God Likewise the innate idea of body is a primary idea since the objective reality it possesses has its origin in the formal reality of body And as just noted the adventitious idea of the Sun is a primary idea since the objective reality it possesses has its origin the formal reality of the Sun Factitious ideas whose contents have their origin in the contents of other ideas no doubt fall into the category of Non Primary idea A non primary idea is one whose objective reality has its origin in the objective reality of some other idea The factitious idea of Pegasus is an example of a non primary idea This alternate scheme Primary and Non Primary although partitioning ideas differently than the initial scheme Innate Adventitious and Factitious appears to do no philosophical harm to Descartes view Even so it is interesting the extent to which Descartes category of primary idea is later echoed in the views of John Locke and David Hume whose respective theories require a similar category which they refer to as simple idea Some scholars believe that in Descartes brief discussion of primary ideas there is suggested a principle of representation Wilson Clatterbaugh Chappell Smith a a The principle is notoriously difficult to formulate and there is no consensus among scholars as to how it is best understood However a large number of scholars agree on one component of the principle which can be expressed as a necessary though not a sufficient condition for representation This principle of representation PR can be expressed as follows PR is at work in Descartes analyses of all primary ideas which includes all innate and adventitious ideas The innate idea of his i e Descartes mind is said to be of or to represent his mind insofar as the idea s objective reality has its origin in the formal reality of his mind The innate idea of God is said to represent God insofar as the idea s objective reality has its origin in the formal reality of God an infinite substance The innate idea of a body is said to represent a body insofar as the idea s objective reality has its origin in the formal reality of a corporeal substance The adventitious idea of the Sun is said to represent the Sun insofar as the idea s objective reality has its origin in the formal reality of the Sun And the list could go on The following analogy may be instructive Suppose that Socrates stands before a mirror Both Socrates and the mirror are actual things so both using Descartes terminology would possess formal reality Each can presumably exist independently of the other The image of Socrates arises as a relation between Socrates and the mirror It cannot exist independently of Socrates or the mirror Destroy Socrates or the mirror and this image of Socrates is destroyed Using Descartes terminology the image is an objective being insofar as it is a representation of Socrates Although the image represents Socrates it is nevertheless located on the mirror s surface And since the surface is a mode of the mirror there is a sense in which this image would be too The mirror is the bearer of the image This is a sense in which the image belongs to the mirror The relationship to Socrates is different The image is said to be an image of Socrates The image is about him He is not the bearer of the image but is what this image represents So the relation that Socrates has to this image must be importantly different from the relation that the mirror has to this image Employing Descartes terminology and in light of PR the image is of Socrates insofar as this objective being the image has its origin in the formal reality of Socrates To be sure the image derives its existence or its formal reality from the formal reality of the mirror but its objective being has its origin not in the mirror but in Socrates It is in the Rules that Descartes introduces the simple natures The simple natures are not only what our ideas are of that is they not only constitute the contents of our ideas the objects immediately presented to the mind but are also the natures possessed by things AT X CSM I Examples of simple natures are colors sounds smells shapes sizes extension and the like He says for example in Rule Twelve if I judge that a certain shape is not moving I shall say that my thought is in some way composed of shape and rest and similarly in other cases AT X CSM I In the First Meditation Descartes mentions similar ideational elements from which all the images of things are formed AT VII CSM II In the Second Meditation in his analysis of the adventitious idea of a piece of wax Descartes again provides a list of such ideational elements AT VII CSM II In the Third Meditation he refers to such items as elements in my ideas AT VII CSM II And in the Sixth Meditation when revisiting some of what he had established in the Second Meditation talk of these qualities that are the only immediate objects of my sensory awareness is again introduced AT VII ff CSM II ff So although Descartes does not employ the simple natures terminology in later work the philosophical notion certainly looks to be present in his later work Simple natures form an ordered hierarchical system Upon analysis they appear to be sorted into two basic groups or classes which not surprisingly corresponds to Descartes mind body dualism AT X CSM I Descartes refers to this partition of simple natures as the enumeration The basic classes of this enumeration will also be partitioned In light of this this ultimate enumeration the partition of the simple natures into the classes of thinking and extended things can be referred to as the master enumeration As laid out in the Rules the hierarchy is not understood in terms of the ontology but in terms of what must be known in terms of what AT X CSM I These groups or classes are formed in light of epistemic priority One group includes those simple natures that presuppose the simple nature thought or thinking while the other group includes those simple natures that presuppose the simple nature extension The view is that the simple nature shape for instance presupposes the simple nature extension in that the former is known understood on the basis of the latter As Descartes puts it later in the Principles shape is unintelligible except in an extended thing AT VIIIA CSM I No extension no shape The same holds for the other class The simple nature hot a sensible quality presupposes the simple nature thought or thinking in that the former is known or understood on the basis of the latter No thought or thinking no feeling of hotness Descartes recognizes two forms of conjunction found among the simple natures necessary and contingent conjunction AT X f CSM I f Two simple natures are said to be necessarily conjoined whenever one presupposes entails the other Ibid So for instance the simple nature shape is necessarily conjoined with the simple nature extension insofar as the former presupposes or entails the latter An idea is said to be clear whenever the necessary conjunction between simple natures in the idea is exhibited or made explicit Descartes procedure for making an idea clearer is to compare the simple natures in the idea He writes that the procedure He goes on to say that Unity is the common nature which we said above all things which we are comparing must participate in equally AT X CSM I See also AT X f CSM I f The simple natures shape and size share in common their presupposing the simple nature extension Extension is the common nature it unites such natures into a single thing a body Thought or thinking is the common nature that unites the other simple natures into a single thing a mind An idea is said to be obscure then whenever no necessary conjunction the presupposes relation is exhibited or made explicit in an idea Ideas are said to be confused whenever they include or contain simple natures belonging to the two mutually exclusive classes of simple nature the two classes together forming the enumeration Here the Latin confusio means mixed together The adventitious idea of the Sun is an example of a confused idea In presenting the Sun as circular shaped and hot the idea includes simple natures that belong to the two mutually exclusive classes Shape belongs to the class whose members presuppose the simple nature extension whereas heat a quality belongs to the class whose members presupposes the simple nature thought or thinking An idea is said to be distinct then whenever it includes or contains only simple natures belonging to one of the mutually exclusive classes The astronomical idea of the Sun as introduced in the Third Meditation looks to be an example of a distinct idea It includes only those simple natures belonging to the class whose members presuppose the simple nature extension Smith In the Third Meditation Descartes introduces what scholars refer to as the truth rule Whatever one perceives clearly and distinctly is true AT VII CSM II In the Fifth Meditation in his analysis of the clear and distinct idea of a triangle Descartes argues that since whatever is true is something i e real AT VII CSM II it follows that everything which I clearly and distinctly perceive to belong to that thing the triangle really does belong to it AT VII CSM II As others have argued Wahl Lennon Smith a Smith for Descartes to say that something was real was in part to say that it existed independently of a finite mind This is the import of Descartes proving the existence of God and body They are real things In his analysis of the idea of the triangle Descartes concludes that the natures that he clearly and distinctly perceives the triangle as possessing are in fact possessed by the triangle These natures are real Russell Wahl has argued that for Descartes truth was related directly to natures Wahl What is true he says is the object before the mind and not the idea not the operation of the mind but what is perceived Wahl p In other words truth is not related to the idea taken materially but to the idea taken objectively This he says is no doubt related to Descartes claim that whatever is true is something real AT VII CSM II The import of this view is that the simple natures which constitute the contents of ideas are also the very same natures possessed by things at least when the idea is clear and distinct Here the simple natures look to be serving as an ontological bridge so to speak between the mind and extra mental reality Wahl s reading is controversial but worth noting since the potentiality lurks in its being able to bring closer together the Representationalist and Direct Realist readings A relatively recent suggestion which emerged in part as a response to the conflict between the Representationalist and Direct Realist interpretations comes from Paul Hoffman Hoffman He bases his suggestion on a view held by Aquinas Given that simple natures are the ontological elements of ideas and things Hoffman in essence argues that it is the simple natures themselves that possess the two kinds of reality that Descartes had introduced in the Third Meditation namely formal and objective reality Hoffman Consider the adventitious idea of the Sun As noted earlier this idea is obscure and confused Even so it reportedly represents the Sun in the heavens Descartes makes clear in the Third Meditation that the astronomical idea of the Sun better resembles the object reportedly in the heavens than does the adventitious idea One way this may be the case is that the astronomical idea is clear and distinct in that it includes only those simple natures that presuppose extension such as shape size motion and so on distinct and it exhibits the presupposition relation clear The Sun is a body whose nature is extension in length breadth and depth The sun as it exists objectively says Hoffman is able to represent the sun as it exists formally in the heavens precisely because it is the same thing that has these two modes of existence Hoffman p That is the Sun possesses both formal and objective reality or rather the simple natures that constitute the thing referred by the words the Sun possess both formal and objective reality Hoffman s suggestion is that it is the objective reality possessed by the simple natures that the mind engages when perceiving the Sun It is via the Sun s objective being that the mind has access to the Sun in the heavens This suggestion would seem to straddle both the Representationalist and Direct Realist interpretations though as Hoffman himself characterizes his view his suggestion leans in the direction of the Direct Realist interpretation That said there is trouble lurking in Hoffman s suggestion Descartes very clearly says that ideas are the items in his ontology that possess objective reality and they possess it by their very nature AT VII CSM II If the Sun for instance or any of the simple natures that constitute the Sun are the items that possess objective reality then the Sun or the simple natures that constitute it are ideas But the Sun or the simple natures that constitute it also presumably possess formal reality which is the kind of reality a thing possesses insofar as it is a real or actual thing If by real Descartes in part means exists independently of a finite mind as Wahl and Lennon contend then the Sun or the simple natures that constitute it insofar as they possess formal reality exist independently of the finite mind This would entail that ideas can and do exist independently of the finite mind But this runs counter to Descartes ontology

Adaptationism refers to a family of views about the importance of natural selection in the evolution of organisms in the construction of evolutionary explanations and in defining the goal of research on evolution Advocates of adaptationism or adaptationists view natural selection among individuals within a population as the only important cause of the evolution of a trait they also typically believe that the construction of explanations based solely on natural selection to be the most fruitful way of making progress in evolutionary biology and that this endeavor addresses the most important goal of evolutionary biology which is to understand the evolution of adaptations An important alternative approach pluralism invokes historical contingency and developmental and genetic constraints in addition to natural selection as important causes of the evolution of a trait Advocates of pluralism or pluralists often also argue that the attempt to construct a natural selective explanation of a trait is not the most fruitful way to make explanatory progress and that understanding adaptation is just one of several important questions in evolutionary biology The debate over adaptationism is commonly understood to be the back and forth between adaptationists and pluralists Biologists and philosophers have recently made three important contributions that have led to better understanding of this debate First they have delineated the differences among various flavors of adaptationism this has helped clarify the biological and philosophical stakes of the debate Second they have clarified standards of evidence for and against adaptationist claims this provides a clearer understanding of how to structure an empirical test of a claim about natural selection and what implications the results of the test have in regard to adaptationism This clarification has the potential not yet fully realized to improve both the practice of science and the philosophical understanding of this practice Third there is improved understanding of the potential role of non selective influences on trait evolution The debate over adaptationism is often traced back to a paper by Stephen Gould and Richard Lewontin called The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme or simply the Spandrels paper This paper is important but in fact this debate traces back to the nineteenth century with elements of adaptationism or pluralism as currently understood being present in the work of Henry Bates William Bateson Charles Darwin Ernst Haeckel Herbert Spencer Alfred Wallace and August Weissman among others see Mayr and Ruse for some of the historical background In the early twentieth century views that we now call adaptationism and pluralism were enunciated by biologists Among them were two of the then and now most influential evolutionary biologists Ronald Fisher and Sewall Wright The central idea of Fisher s important book The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection is that natural selection is the only important influence on trait evolution This is the central text of adaptationism indeed it has an honored place in the minds of most evolutionary biologists no matter what their position on adaptationism compare Grafen and Kimura Issued again in in a revised edition and in in a variorum edition this book has garnered over journal citations over have occurred since Web of Science June Sewall Wright s pluralist view of evolution was presented in several places with his paper Evolution in Mendelian Populations and the book Evolution and the Genetics of Populations Volume Experimental Results and Evolutionary Deductions being the best known The paper has received over citations over have occurred since while the book has received over citations since Web of Science June These works by Fisher and Wright are canonical contributions to the field of evolutionary biology They were based partially on prior claims and counterclaims about the influence of natural selection and of non selective forces on trait evolution especially in species such as land snails that have easily distinguishable trait variation see Millstein a In turn these works stimulated continuing claims and counterclaims The mid s explosion of citations reflects the fact that the number of biologists studying ecology and evolution increased markedly as compared to the early s and that evolutionary biology gained separate departmental status at many universities these changes were in part caused by the increased societal awareness and concern at that time about pollution and the impact of humans on the environment There were two central but mainly disjunct scientific developments that energized the proliferation and refinement of adaptationist and of pluralist views during this period The first was the extensive development of strategic claims in evolutionary ecology which in the case of a given trait say the allocation of energy to male and to female offspring e g Hamilton see also Charnov provides an explanation as to why the observed trait is locally optimal Such a claim invokes only natural selection as an important causal explanation of the trait The second development was the neutral theory in population genetics which posits that natural selection plays little or no role in determining DNA and protein sequence variation in natural populations e g Kimura The former development generated little initial controversy while the latter development immediately generated lasting controversy see Dietrich It is this combination of social institutional and scientific developments that formed the background to Gould and Lewontin s paper which can be best understood as an important but not singular event in a long standing debate in evolutionary biology It is neither the beginning of the debate over adaptationism nor something much narrower e g little more than the attempted intellectual lynching of sociobiology cf Queller see also Pigliucci and Kaplan Such claims are at best historically incorrect Recent work in the philosophy of biology Orzack and Sober a Sober Amundson Godfrey Smith has helped uncover three flavors of adaptationism these reflect differences in beliefs among current professional developers and users of evolutionary arguments They represent commitments about the state of nature about the way to do science and about what is important to study The first flavor empirical adaptationism is the view that natural selection is ubiquitous free from constraints and provides a sufficient explanation for the evolution of most traits which are locally optimal that is the observed trait is superior to any alternative that does not require redefining the organism Orzack and Sober a This is a claim about the realized influence of natural selection on the evolution of traits as compared to other evolutionary influences The second flavor explanatory adaptationism is the view that explaining traits as adaptations resulting from natural selection is the central goal of evolutionary biology This is a claim about the greater importance of some kinds of explanations Opinions differ as to whether this is a scientific claim or an aesthetic claim see below The third flavor methodological adaptationism is the view that looking first for adaptation via natural selection is the most efficient approach when trying to understand the evolution of any given trait This could be true even if adaptations are rare although a substantial majority of biologists believe that adaptations are common The belief that adaptations are common is quite different from the claim that only natural selection need be invoked in order to explain these adaptations The flavors of adaptationism are logically independent The truth of one claim does not necessarily imply the truth of the other claims For example it could be true that most traits are adaptations that can be explained by invoking no more than natural selection the first flavor but still be false that it is most fruitful to look first for adaptation the third flavor In fact realized intellectual stances are more circumscribed in that most adaptationists are advocates of empirical explanatory and methodological adaptationism e g Charnov Dawkins Maynard Smith In addition there are many biologists who are advocates of explanatory and methodological adaptationism but who explicitly reject empirical adaptationism e g Mayr On the other hand some biologists reject all three flavors of adaptationism e g Carroll Wagner et al West Eberhard There are many instances of competing adaptationist and pluralist explanations of the same biology For example Cain and Sheppard and Lamotte famously present competing explanations of morphological traits in land snails Ackermann and Cheverud test adaptationist and pluralist explanations of the diversification of morphological evolution of humans and their ancestors Millstein b illustrates the differences between adaptationism and pluralism by presenting the same biology of a heat shock protein from both perspectives Distinguishing among the flavors of adaptationism was an important advance in our biological and philosophical understanding These flavors of adaptationism differ in their practical implications for evolutionary biology We now discuss each in detail Godfrey Smith page defined empirical adaptationism as follows Natural selection is a powerful and ubiquitous force and there are few constraints on the biological variation that fuels it To a large degree it is possible to predict and explain the outcome of evolutionary processes by attending only to the role played by selection No other evolutionary factor has this degree of causal importance This definition captures two important beliefs of adaptationists The first is that natural selection governs all important aspects of trait evolution and that other evolutionary influences will be of little consequence at least over the long term The second is that the order in nature is a consequence of natural selection Parker and Maynard Smith is an important example of this approach Empirical adaptationism is typically regarded as descriptive of the evolution of directly observable traits such as leg length e g Vella A dizzying variety of traits has been analyzed from the perspective of empirical adaptationism many specific examples can be found in Hardy Stephens et al and Westneat and Fox Many proponents of empirical adaptationism concede that important aspects of the evolution of DNA and protein sequences are little influenced by natural selection The important methodological implication of empirical adaptationism stems from the causal power that it assigns to natural selection an apparent discrepancy between data and the predictions of an optimality model should be resolved by rejection of that model and development of a new model This is justified by an appeal to our always imperfect knowledge of nature e g see Cain This contrasts with the pluralist perspective such a discrepancy might well provide evidence against natural selection Many views counter to empirical adaptationism have been enunciated Some dispense with natural selection entirely or nearly so such as in the study of molecular evolution where there are neutral evolutionary explanations for many features of the genome e g Lynch b Some retain natural selection within populations as an important evolutionary force but endorse the importance of other forces e g Crespi Goodwin Carroll while others go further and invoke natural selection among populations or species along with natural selection within populations Gould Jablonski Godfrey Smith page defined explanatory adaptationism in this way The apparent design of organisms and the relations of adaptedness between organisms and their environments are the big questions the amazing facts in biology Explaining these phenomena is the core intellectual mission of evolutionary theory Natural selection is the key to solving these problems selection is the big answer Because it answers the biggest questions selection has unique explanatory importance among evolutionary factors Explanatory adaptationism is viewed by its proponents e g Dawkins Dennett and Griffiths as important because it organizes research to understand how natural selection underlies the world around us To this extent it can be viewed as an untestable aesthetic claim instead of as a scientific claim At minimum it is a claim as to the proper goal of science as a manifestation of human reason and enlightenment Amundson claims that explanatory adaptationism is a stance about the natural world and the products of scientific inquiry instead of being a view about biology or how best to do science However explanatory adaptationism may have normative implications for evolutionary biologists if adopting it is necessary in order to construct sensible explanations in developmental biology and physiology Griffiths Viewed as an aesthetic claim explanatory adaptationism has no practical implications for science but it does have implications for the public debate about the relevance of biology to our image of humanity In particular Dennett and Dawkins argue that this perspective counters the natural theological argument from design and vindicates a secular humanist perspective Biologists not advocating explanatory adaptationism view the central mission of evolutionary biology differently For example many systematists believe that describing the history of life is the central mission of evolutionary biology in doing so one might be agnostic about the evolutionary forces influencing this history see Hull and Felsenstein for further details Godfrey Smith page defined methodological adaptationism in this way The best way for scientists to approach biological systems is to look for features of adaptation and good design Adaptation is a good organizing concept for evolutionary research This is a claim about the efficiency of tools No matter how incorrect it may ultimately be to invoke natural selection as a sufficient explanation for a trait it is the most direct way possible to find the true causal explanation of a trait Methodological adaptationism differs markedly from empirical adaptationism in that the former acknowledges the possibility that natural selection may ultimately prove not to have the most influence on a given trait s evolution In addition a methodological adaptationist can accept that an apparent discrepancy between data and the predictions of a model of natural selection may be resolved by concluding that the trait is little influenced by natural selection instead of by concluding that the model is incorrect One potential argument against methodological adaptationism is that a mixture of distinct approaches is superior at advancing knowledge as compared to a single approach Kitcher Allowing for a division of cognitive labor could be a good thing perhaps evolutionary biology benefits from an array of methodological strategies with differing degrees of risk This contrasts with the view that multiple approaches with conflicting assumptions are a hindrance Views counter to methodological adaptationism range from strong views that deny that adaptation is a good guiding concept to weaker views that privilege different explanations For example Gould and Lewontin s argument for considering constraint based Bauplan explanations before or along side selective explanations is an example of methodological anti adaptationism An important part of the adaptationism debate concerns the testing of adaptive and non adaptive hypotheses The belief that scientific practice in evolutionary biology does not adhere to the proper standards of evidence motivates many of the critiques of adaptationism This concern has been taken seriously by some evolutionary biologists for example Rose and Lauder claimed that a central task of contemporary evolutionary biology is to articulate a post Spandrels adaptationism a task that involves improving testing methods by including comparative and molecular data conducting careful long term studies in both the laboratory and the wild and incorporating a more comprehensive understanding of development and constraint We now discuss testing of adaptationism itself and the associated implications for testing evolutionary hypotheses generally and the sort of epistemic difficulties that must be overcome We highlight how the debate has led to increased understanding of the importance of phylogenetic methods of the viability of optimality models as tools for testing adaptive hypotheses and of whether constraint hypotheses are rivals to adaptive hypotheses or provide the backdrop against which we test hypotheses about the evolutionary process Orzack and Sober a b see also Orzack proposed an approach for testing empirical adaptationism In their view the truth of empirical adaptationism is a possible outcome of testing of optimality models as opposed to being something that is decided a priori Their proposal the Adaptationism Project involves assembling specific kinds of analyses of traits in order to assess the relative frequency and importance of natural selection across the biological realm In order to contribute to the ensemble test an analysis must include an assessment of the quantitative fit of the optimality model and of the within population heterogeneity of fit to the predictions see below and Orzack and Sober a for why these assessments are required At present there are very few trait analyses that contain these elements after an extensive literature review Orzack and Sober identified only Brockmann and Dawkins Brockmann et al Orzack and Parker and Orzack et al as analyses that contain the required assessments Of course to conduct an ensemble test important methodological difficulties must be confronted including how to choose populations and species to analyze and how many cases are necessary to provide an adequate test The name Adaptationism Project is an acknowledgement of a parallel to the Human Genome Project both are carried out by a consortium of investigators and require advance organization of the process by which knowledge is gathered instead of just occurring willy nilly This is an ambitious project but one that is achievable cf the Genome K project which is also an effort to create an unprecedented data ensemble Genome K Ensemble tests have a long precedent in biology and evolutionary biology although none appear to have been prospectively organized For example we have the ensemble conclusion that almost all speciation occurs via geographical isolation Mayr or that the genetic code is nearly universal Crick Either or both of these claims could be true but the present empirical knowledge that generated either one is not even remotely close to being based on a sample of organisms that could be taken to be representative of all species Empirical adaptationism is both a claim about the relative frequency of natural selection across evolutionary histories and about the power of natural selection to overcome constraints and contingency Orzack and Sober s a b ensemble test of the truth of empirical adaptationism is structured in the following way for any given trait T In order to contribute to the ensemble test the analysis of the trait must allow the investigator to confirm one of the following hypotheses about the power of natural selection U Natural selection played some role in the evolution of T U denotes ubiquitous since this proposition applies to most traits I Natural selection was an important cause of the evolution of T I denotes important O Natural selection is a sufficient explanation of the evolution of T and T is locally optimal O denotes optimal Orzack and Sober claimed that empirical adaptationism is a generalization of O namely that natural selection is a sufficient explanation for most nonmolecular traits and those traits are locally optimal Orzack and Sober provided a specific protocol to assess whether O is true for a particular trait It involves comparing the predictive accuracy of a censored evolutionary model one that invokes only natural selection and an alternative uncensored model that invokes additional evolutionary influences such as genetic drift random trait change caused by population number being finite or constraints caused by the way the trait is determined genetically or developmentally If the censored model is quantitatively accurate and there is no within population heterogeneity of fit to predictions and the uncensored model fails in either regard then one can infer that natural selection is a sufficient explanation for trait T Optimality models embody proposition O in that natural selection is assumed to be the only important influence on the focal trait s evolution the result is assumed to be the evolution of a trait that maximizes individual fitness Of course an optimality model like any evolutionary model must include background assumptions and constraints that anchor the local analysis of the focal trait However given these assumptions natural selection is assumed to act without constraint on the trait There is some controversy over the protocol for testing whether natural selection is a sufficient explanation of a trait Brandon and Rausher objected that local optimality is a distinct claim and so tests for the importance of natural selection should not use optimality models whose use they equate to theft which they believe means that such models are generically incompatible with universal aspects of the biology of organisms They also take issue with how the predictive accuracy of censored and uncensored models should be assessed Godfrey Smith makes the observation that the censored and uncensored test models typically have different complexity More complex models usually fit the data better but risk obscuring the underlying trend or comprising predictive accuracy there may be a problem of over fitting lurking here see e g Gauch for an overview of the curve fitting problem Extending this framework to molecular traits where completely neutral evolution is a plausible explanation requires expanding the set of hypotheses about natural selection It now should include Some argue that N is rarely if ever true e g Gillespie whereas others argue otherwise e g Kimura Lynch a An ensemble test involving molecular traits would help resolve this controversy In addition the notion of optimality at the molecular level must be made precise A molecular trait needs to have an identified phenotypic consequence The endeavor to identify such a consequence will likely always involve a combination of very detailed molecular biochemical and phenotypic analyses However despite the difficulty of the needed analyses there are claims as to the optimality of various molecular traits A canonical example is the claim that triosephosphate isomerase an enzyme involved in glycolysis in animals fungi plants and some bacteria is catalytically perfect Albery and Knowles this is a claim that hypothesis O is true For molecular traits the assessment of the influence of natural selection i e distinguishing between hypothesis N and hypotheses U and I is facilitated by the degeneracy of the genetic code and the existence of non coding regions in the genome We expect heterogeneity of the realized influence of natural selection among sites in the genome and differences in evolutionary rates between sites where a DNA base change alters the protein sequence and those sites that it does not see examples in Graur and Li Kreitman and Akashi Nielsen and Yang The debate over adaptationism contains claims and counterclaims about what hypotheses should be included in an analysis of the adaptiveness of a trait This is crucial because assessments of evidentiary support depend on what hypotheses we consider see Sober Earman We must consider all the relevant hypotheses in order to provide good evidence for a hypothesis Stanford Forber One common pluralist complaint is that adaptationists neglect this standard of evidence Such an inclusive standard is essential because many different evolutionary trajectories can lead to the same outcome As Gould and Lewontin wrote One must not confuse the fact that a structure is used in some way with the primary evolutionary reason for its existence and conformation In addition subtle differences in evolutionary history may lead to different evolutionary outcomes Beatty and Desjardins Thus we cannot conclude that natural selection played an important role in the evolution of some trait just because we have a plausible adaptive hypothesis in mind Indeed finding suitable evidence for an adaptive or non adaptive hypothesis is difficult because we lack good epistemic access to evolutionary history This lack of access is a premise of Gould and Lewontin s critique and it motivates their call to evaluate testing methods in evolutionary biology especially those methods that consider only adaptive hypotheses with no regard for non adaptive rivals Biologists have continued to develop new testing methods that do this see e g Rose and Lauder Hansen et al This aspect of the adaptationism debate is connected with a general epistemological issue in philosophy of science underdetermination of theory by evidence Evolutionary hypotheses are typically underdetermined by available evidence In principle rival hypotheses make different commitments about the nature of evolutionary history but in practice these hypotheses are empirically indistinguishable given the available evidence Philosophers argue about the consequences of this underdetermination for our understanding of biological science Turner Stanford Yet there is agreement that the problem of underdetermination should be addressed by developing and using tests that discriminate between rival hypotheses Evidentiary relations depend on what hypotheses we compare and so good testing methods should include all rival hypotheses If we fail to include a relevant rival say one that emphasizes developmental constraint then we may not have found sufficient evidence for the adaptive hypothesis Failing to contrast adaptive and non adaptive explanations weakens any adaptationist analysis Forber Evolutionary hypotheses make a variety of commitments about development ecology genetics and history As a result an adaptive hypothesis makes contact with evolutionary history only in conjunction with a number of auxiliary hypotheses The most convincing case for an adaptive hypothesis will include a variety of evidence especially independent data that confirm the different facets of an evolutionary hypothesis Lloyd Sober s analysis of a testing protocol for evolutionary hypotheses makes clear the role of auxiliary hypotheses and assesses the evidentiary import of different observed outcomes He provides an analysis of whether and how fit between an optimality model and the observed population mean favors natural selection over genetic drift The adaptationism debate has helped clarify the importance of comparative methods for testing adaptive hypotheses The relatedness among species due to common ancestry can reduce the amount of seemingly independent evidence one has for or against any evolutionary hypothesis Species with a recent common ancestor may have inherited the same trait from the ancestor as opposed to evolving it independently of one another Comparative methods help one assess the extent to which a set of related species provide independent evidence for or against a given evolutionary hypothesis Harvey and Pagel The general awareness of the need to use such methods stems primarily from the initially narrower debate that took place within systematics in the s and s over how to create classifications of organisms that are scientific and as such are transparent recipes that are accessible to others instead of being private and non scientific This debate generated tremendous controversy Hull and it spurred on the development of methods to statistically correct for dependence among species trait values when assessing an adaptive hypothesis Felsenstein Harvey and Pagel In addition it became more widely understood that a claim that one trait evolved in response to another is enormously strengthened by phylogenetic confirmation the history of trait acquisition must be consistent with the hypothesis see Maddison and references therein These developments are salutary in that they show biologists how to better test adaptive hypotheses and have clarified the phylogenetic assumptions that are necessary to test adaptive hypotheses Sober and Orzack As such they are a methodological improvement that has generally gained a positive reception among philosophers of biology e g Sterelny and Griffiths Many biologists agree but controversy continues Some acknowledge the potential importance of comparative methods but point to limitations that may reduce their usefulness Reeve and Sherman Leroi et al As such these critiques are consistent with methodological adaptationism Others view any allusion to potential non adaptive influences on trait evolution to be mistaken in their view the importance of phylogenetic methods is that they help reveal complete history of natural selection on the trait Grafen As such this is a critique consistent with the espousal of empirical adaptationism Claims and counterclaims about the use of optimality models for understanding evolution are a central part of the debate over adaptationism although some believe that there is no necessary connection between optimality modeling and adaptationism Potochnik While many biologists believe that optimality models are useful whether evolution by natural selection tends to produce optimal traits is controversial see e g Dupr Optimality models put the contingencies of history and developmental and genetic constraints in to the background so as to focus on natural selection Much work in evolutionary game theory embodies this approach Most game theoretic models are used to describe the evolution by natural selection of strategic behavior to a local optimum called an evolutionarily stable strategy Maynard Smith but see Orzack and Hines and Huttegger among others This approach has the assumption that there is direct selection on the trait under analysis This is often justified on the grounds that there exists a good fit between the trait and its current function Maynard Smith or that natural selection is ubiquitous in nature Mayr The Spandrels paper targeted these general arguments for optimality models Biologists have discovered many ways in which the genetic details of trait determination and or ecological details of the population can prevent the evolution of optima For example interaction between loci linkage or pleiotropy can prevent the optimal phenotype from being fixed in a population and thereby prevent the maximization of mean fitness Moran Such a deviation from the state of highest fitness is called genetic load The standard adaptationist response is that genetic and ecological constraints are eliminated over evolutionary time by the introduction of new genetic variation via mutation Parker and Maynard Smith While this controversy has been divisive Schwartz there are prospects for a synthesis First Eshel and Feldman distinguished between short term evolution the evolutionary dynamics of a fixed set of genotypes and long term evolution bouts of short term evolution interspersed with introductions of new genetic variation They noted page that long term evolution proceeds by an infinite sequence of transitions from one fixed set of genotypes to another fixed set of genotypes with each of these sets subject to short term evolution Optima are often not accessible in the short term due to constraints on available variation However genetic variation may be introduced over the long term so that the population eventually reaches an optimum The substantive point is that we now understand how apparent short term impediments to optimality can be resolved over the long term Mutations must appear at the right time and the ecology must remain stable over the long term whether these conditions are met frequently enough in nature to justify the optimality approach is an empirical issue see also Hammerstein The second prospect for synthesis is Wilkins and Godfrey Smith s proposal that the truth of empirical adaptationism and the concomitant application of optimality models depends on the intended grain of resolution of the evolutionary analysis At a fine grain of resolution when there are few peaks in the adaptive landscape most observed populations may be on or near these peaks Adaptationism is appropriate at this resolution If we zoom out and look at a grand landscape over large regions of morphospace the situation changes At a very coarse grain of resolution much of morphospace is empty and constraints often explain why certain regions remain unexplored by biological evolution Adaptationism is inappropriate at this resolution Finally the focus on optimality modeling in connection to adaptationism has led to a precise statement of how the nature of fit between data and the predictions of an optimality model influence the degree of evidentiary support for the adaptive hypothesis Orzack and Sober a b Qualitative agreement by itself is not sufficient to accept the hypothesis of local optimality Instead quantitative agreement and an assessment of nature of possible between individual heterogeneity of fit to model predictions are required in order to have evidence for optimality without both of these test components acceptance of the hypothesis of optimality is not warranted see above One issue in the debate over adaptationism and optimality models concerns whether constraint hypotheses count as genuine alternatives to adaptive hypotheses Gould and Lewontin view constraint hypotheses as competing with adaptive hypotheses as explanations of traits Advocates of optimality models e g Maynard Smith Roughgarden take the set of evolutionary constraints to be a background commitment of any optimality model The constraint set may include developmental and genetic constraints on variation and transmission but it is natural selection that drives evolution and so explains the trait given those constraints Advocates of optimality models treat constraints as presupposed by adaptive hypotheses A concern of many critics of adaptationism is that this treatment of constraints undervalues their role in explaining evolutionary form and novelty Developmental processes may limit the spectrum of evolutionary trajectories available to a lineage Maynard Smith et al page defined a developmental constraint as a bias on the production of variant phenotypes or a limitation on phenotypic variability caused by the structure character composition or dynamics of the developmental system More recently the definition of constraint has become more nuanced see e g Wagner and Altenberg Winther Part of the controversy over constraints can be resolved by distinguishing between constraint on adaptation and constraint on form Amundson In the former certain trajectories are less likely because they require populations to leave local optima or peaks in the adaptive landscape In this case natural selection limits the potential evolutionary trajectories In the latter case certain trajectories are unavailable due to the structure of the current developmental system Advocates of optimality models often argue that building and testing such models provides the best way to identify and discover evolutionary constraints and that these constraints can then be used to build better optimality models Amundson Seger and Stubblefield Many biologists that analyze the evolution of development or evo devo use a different set of molecular and morphological investigative techniques to uncover robust and important developmental constraints see e g M ller and Newman Kirschner and Gerhart They object that the concept of optimality is a poor tool for answering their research questions The recognition of two kinds of constraints resolves this dispute We see then that optimality modeling usually entails the incorporation of or the discovery of constraints on adaptation whereas studies of evolution and development investigates constraints on form A full understanding of evolutionary history requires a synthesis of these approaches Developmental and genetic constraint hypotheses do not invoke causal processes in the same way that adaptive hypotheses do Can such different hypotheses compete with one another This aspect of the adaptationism debate connects biology to an important puzzle about the nature of causation and explanation If explanation amounts to identifying causes then constraints must be causes to explain evolutionary outcomes But how can impediments have a causal influence on the evolutionary trajectory of a lineage One possible answer is that they don t have any causal influence they are merely the background against which natural selection operates Such a view treats causes as part of a process or involving some kind of energy transfer Dowe This view of causation vindicates the adaptationist view that the constraint set is presupposed by any respectable adaptive hypothesis For adaptationists new constraints simply mean that we need to build new models Testing is then just a matter of comparing different adaptive hypotheses that have different constraints The other possible answer is that constraints do have a causal influence on evolution because they prevent evolutionary trajectories from attaining some outcomes This view is consistent with counterfactual and interventionist approaches to causation such as the comprehensive one defended by Woodward and vindicates the approach of treating constraints as genuine alternatives to adaptive hypotheses Linking this debate to philosophical ideas about causation can help us evaluate whether evolutionary constraints count as genuine alternatives Constraints are defined as biases or limitations on the production of variation From the perspective of causation this is a heterogeneous combination Constraints that bias a lineage towards certain evolutionary trajectories look like productive probabilistic causes and avoid certain conceptual entanglements that face boundaries or limitations Innovations in the developmental makeup of an organism can make new changes and subsequent evolutionary trajectories more likely a hallmark of a causal factor This helps clarify the importance of evolutionary innovation Innovations that produce biases may be crucial to explaining major evolutionary transitions such as the emergence of multicellularity Sterelny When certain changes make new evolutionary outcomes more likely they are part of the explanation of those new outcomes Such biases count as probabilistic causal influences since they change the probability of a lineage taking certain evolutionary trajectories Hitchcock Whether boundaries count as causes and thereby explain evolutionary outcomes is more problematic A prevailing view within evolutionary biology is that constraints must count as causal influences whatever our account of causation whether it be by prevention or by omission see Woodward for discussion Gould and Lewontin adopted this position Sansom argued that the debate over the evolutionary importance of constraint amounts to an issue about the relative causal contributions of constraint and natural selection to evolutionary outcomes The causal contribution of constraint can be assessed by using comparative data in order to compare evolutionary outcomes of lineages with and without the constraint of interest If there is a difference then the constraint has an identifiable causal influence all other things being equal Pigliucci and Kaplan proposed a test protocol based on transition matrices in which probabilities of evolutionary change are specified under natural selection and under one or more competing constraint hypotheses so as to test natural selection against constraint More philosophical analysis is required to assess the viability of this approach Whatever the position on whether constraints count as causes the lesson to be taken from this part of the adaptationism debate is that it is essential to precisely specify the rival evolutionary hypotheses There are many examples of such precise specification in the biological literature For example Frank and Stubblefield and Seger analyzed the influence on sex ratio optima of different constraints on the information available to parents Lloyd described the evidentiary support for explanations of the evolution of the female orgasm Lloyd s analysis supports Symons proposal that the female orgasm exists because of a developmental constraint in combination with strong selection for the male orgasm If males fail to achieve orgasm then no reproduction occurs The tissue responsible for the male orgasm appears early in human development long before sexual dimorphism occurs and this tissue is found in both male and female sexual organs This example contains competing hypotheses that have commitments about boundaries and about natural selection The Symons constraint explanation invokes a feature of development and indirect selection on a different trait whereas the adaptive hypothesis does not incorporate the developmental constraint and instead posits a direct role for selection There is room for reconciliation here As adaptationists point out any evolutionary hypothesis must assume some constraints so the accusation that optimality models fail to include constraints is incorrect But pluralists are right to argue that in some cases constraints may play a significant role in the evolution of some trait and that the correct evolutionary explanation may not even include natural selection for the trait Constraints are often understood as biases or limitations on potential evolutionary trajectories How do we identify potential trajectories This will depend on how biology provides counterfactual information We cannot appeal solely to realized evolutionary history since not all potential trajectories have occurred Evo devo research on novelty provides one of the best strategies for exploring potential evolutionary trajectories Wagner a b Muller and Wagner Calcott As the causal mechanisms underlying development are better understood we will gain a better grasp on the nature of constraints and how they explain evolutionary outcomes Why should biologists and philosophers care about the debate over adaptationism This debate has been and will continue to be important to biologists because it helps clarify how to do better evolutionary biology Despite this a minority of currently active biologists contribute to the debate about adaptationism and many ignore it or disparage it For a variety of reasons many of the important points that have arisen from the debate such as how to structure empirical tests of adaptive hypotheses and optimality models go unheeded For example claims for local optimality continue to appear that lack a specification of even a single alternative hypothesis to the adaptive hypothesis This lack inevitably leaves ambiguous the status of the adaptive hypothesis In addition standards for rejection of the only adaptive hypothesis continue to be rarely delineated if at all The debate over adaptationism will continue to be important to philosophers of biology because much will be gained by a more informed understanding of the use of hypotheses about natural selection by biologists In the s and s there was a general tendency to misunderstand the conceptual commitments of users of optimality models More recently there has been a growing understanding of the variety of conceptual commitments held by users of such models especially that the use and development of an optimality model need not bind the user to a blind acceptance of the claim that natural selection is all powerful biology philosophy of Darwinism developmental biology evolution and development evolution evolution concept before Darwin game theory

Described as perhaps the greatest empiricist of the th century Salmon a the work of Hans Reichenbach provides one of the main statements of empiricist philosophy in the th century Provoked by the conflict between neo Kantian a priorism and Einstein s relativity of space and time Reichenbach developed a scientifically inspired philosophy and an uncompromisingly empiricist epistemology He was literate in the physical science of his time and acquainted with many of its most eminent practitioners Criticism and justification of scientific methodology formed the core of almost all his philosophical efforts which he promoted in a crescendo of books in the journal Erkenntnis which he founded and edited with Rudolf Carnap and within a group of philosophers mathematicians and scientists he led in Berlin His commitment to objectivity and realism in science together with his probabilistic justification of belief in scientific results carried philosophical and technical difficulties that shaped much of the subsequent debate in philosophy of science Reichenbach s contributions cover large swathes of formal philosophy especially in philosophy of physics logic induction and the foundations of probability and his later work encompassed linguistics philosophical logic and ethics The fruits of some of his insights are only belatedly having their full impact For example several of the recent accounts of causality employ ideas that can be traced to Reichenbach s The Direction of Time Partitioning the work of a philosopher with views about almost everything is indispensable in a retrospective but in Reichenbach s case separation is especially artificial From until most of his philosophical essays entangle issues and doctrines about probability causality physics epistemology and metaphysics Reichenbach s ideas about causality and probability are so intertwined that it makes little sense to discuss them separately Unavoidably therefore different aspects of the same works are discussed in several sections of the following essay Reichenbach s views on all of these topics changed so radically over time that there is no one Reichenbach system and we therefore offer a synoptic history of his views within each topic All of our citations are from the English editions of his publications where available Born in Hamburg Germany in Hans Reichenbach was the second of four children of a half Jewish but baptized father and a non Jewish mother In secondary school and at university he was active in the socialist student movement From to he studied civil engineering at the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart and then moved among Berlin Munich and G ttingen studying physics philosophy and mathematics with some of the eminences of the time including Ernst Cassirer Max Planck Arnold Sommerfeld and David Hilbert He wrote his doctoral dissertation largely on his own after the neo Kantian Paul Natorp would not accept him as his student After searching for alternative advisors his dissertation was finally accepted by Paul Hensel a philosopher and Max Noether a mathematician in in Erlangen Reichenbach was conscripted into the army while completing his thesis He served in the German army signal corps on the Russian front until a serious illness sent him back to Berlin in He was relieved from active military duty in to work as an engineer for a firm specializing in radio technology In Berlin Reichenbach attended Albert Einstein s lectures on relativity and statistical mechanics which influenced him profoundly and inaugurated a life long friendship between the two men He wrote several popular articles defending Einstein especially in the context of the observations of the solar eclipse of confirming the predictions of the general theory of relativity In Reichenbach became an instructor in physics and eventually associate professor at the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart The Theory of Relativity and A Priori Knowledge f was accepted as his habilitation in physics In this period Reichenbach married Elizabeth Lingener and they had two children Hans Galama in and Elizabeth Jutta in While in Stuttgart he developed contacts with Moritz Schlick Rudolf Carnap and Erwin Schroedinger In after much back and forth he assumed a teaching position in natural philosophy at the University of Berlin where he remained until Hitler came to power in During this time Reichenbach organized discussion groups on scientific philosophy similar to those of the Vienna Circle The group around Reichenbach that developed out of the Society for Empirical Philosophy and became known as the Berlin Group included Walter Dubislav Kurt Grelling Wolfgang K hler Kurt Lewin and later Carl Hempel Reichenbach s student Together with members of the Vienna Circle Reichenbach initiated the publication of the journal Erkenntnis in as a forum for scientific philosophy Reichenbach and Carnap were the only editors after Schlick resigned in reaction to Reichenbach s opening article see Section below In addition and also for financial reasons Reichenbach was a frequent contributor of popular essays and a regular radio lecturer on scientific topics With Hitler s elevation the views and methods of the Berlin Group and Vienna Circle were branded Jewish philosophy and Reichenbach who counted as Jewish to the National Socialists and was in any case considered undesirable given his socialist writings as a student was dismissed from his university position and from radio work He moved to Istanbul in where as part of his efforts to westernize Turkey Mustafa Kemal Atat rk had established a new university to attract intellectuals fleeing Europe Reichenbach was joined there by other German professors notably Richard von Mises the mathematician whose views on probability must have influenced Reichenbach and Erwin Freundlich Freundlich had been Einstein s assistant in Berlin on matters astronomical led an unsuccessful German expedition to Russia to measure the gravitational deflection of starlight at the solar eclipse the members of the expedition became prisoners of war and later joined the Einstein Observatory in Potsdam Under a five year contract which prevented him from accepting a position at New York University arranged by Einstein and Sidney Hook Reichenbach remained in Turkey until when through the efforts of many people most notably Charles Morris Reichenbach moved to the University of California Los Angeles UCLA with his family Hiking in the Swiss Alps shortly before his move to Los Angeles Reichenbach suffered a heart attack which prevented him from teaching during the first months of his American appointment Reichenbach was an avid hiker and skier but not physically impressive His student Cynthia Schuster describes his appearance around this way short almost rotund stubby hands and feet round face snub nose thick glasses false teeth a hearing aid and a thin high pitched speaking voice Reichenbach vol I His influence on students she says was a case of mind over matter With the US entry into World War II in Reichenbach as a resident German alien was kept under effective house arrest allowed to leave only to work and for medical purposes until he obtained American citizenship in During the war Reichenbach was engaged in helping to move members of his family out of Germany and to secure positions for colleagues at UCLA in particular members of the Frankfurt School Theodor Adorno Max Horkheimer who with Berthold Brecht and Thomas Mann became part of Reichenbach s German intellectual circle in Los Angeles In he was reunited with Maria Moll who had been his colleague in Istanbul They married in the day after her divorce Despite bitter discussions at UCLA about the McCarthy era California Loyalty Oath in which each faculty member had to attest that they were not members of the Communist party we are not aware of any written objections from Reichenbach He signed the oath in apparently unwillingly as an understanding letter from Rudolf Carnap suggests McCumber p Reichenbach s untimely death from another heart attack on April prevented him from presenting the William James Lectures at Harvard in the fall of the same year and also prevented his inclusion in a planned volume of Living Philosophers in the series edited by Arthur Schilpp

Reichenbach s move to Istanbul and the decisions and hurdles that eventually took him to the U S Avkiran who also includes a wealth of references in Turkish and Roure describe Reichenbach s time in Istanbul and explain his limited influence on philosophy in Turkey Reichenbach s doctoral thesis The Concept of Probability in the Mathematical Representation of Reality b contains many of the themes that concerned him throughout his life and anticipated in some detail st century philosophical discussions of probability relations between microscopic and macroscopic systems Indeed the development of his ideas about causality and probability from until the end of his life can be seen as a series of reexaminations and reformulations of issues the thesis implicitly posed and the solutions it explicitly offered The thesis develops an account of probability appropriate for scientific inference It presents an argument to supplement what Reichenbach understands to be Kant s transcendental principle of causality with a transcendental principle of probability In Reichenbach s reading of Kant the principle of causality asserts that every event is preceded by a cause that determines it according to some universal law see the discussion of Kant s principle in Section of the entry on Kant and Hume on Causality The principle is transcendental because it cannot be empirically established but is instead a precondition for the very possibility of empirical knowledge Reichenbach s claim is that there is a principle of probability that has an equal status it cannot be empirically established but it is a precondition of empirical knowledge It states that events are governed by a probability distribution Reichenbach considers and rejects the subjective interpretation of probability advocated by the then prominent philosopher and psychologist Carl Stumpf a b and less emphatically the attempt at an objective interpretation advocated by Johannes von Kries a physiologist who had studied with Hermann von Helmholtz According to Reichenbach von Kries s account of probability needs to be freed from the principle of insufficient reason that mutually exclusive events of which we have no knowledge that would determine differential probability are equally probable As a subjective principle Reichenbach claimed it had no place in science Reichenbach insists on an objective interpretation of probability in the Kantian sense as about the world of experience for which probability statements are synthetic but not verifiable claims about the empirical world His task as he sees it is to demonstrate that probabilistic statements are supported by a claim the existence of a probability function which is a transcendental principle that is necessary and in combination with causal principles sufficient for empirical knowledge Reichenbach s technical argument is an adaptation of Henri Poincar s results on probability functions and what have since come to be called strike ratios Poincar pp By considering events collected in a histogram in which alternate equally narrow columns are black and white Reichenbach argues that as the number of independent events increases and the width of the columns decreases the ratio of black to white events within any interval of the abscissa will approximate Reichenbach s general idea is that if a variable X is divided into two or more classes of very small intervals of equal width in X units juxtaposed in a definite order and proportion then there will be a probability for the occurrence of a value of X within any particular class that is invariant over all Riemann integrable probability distributions for X The Riemann integral of a function describing a curve is defined as the limit of the sum of rectangles touching the curve as their width approaches Reichenbach extends the analysis to error probabilities for physical measurements He then argues that since all physical measurements are subject to error knowledge of natural laws is possible only if errors occur subject to a probability distribution a proposition that is synthetic but cannot be established empirically Empirical knowledge thus requires both an a priori principle of causality for individual events and an a priori principle of probability to ensure that individual events can be aggregated into general laws No explicit interpretation of probability is forwarded although Reichenbach implies that probability claims are about frequencies of causally independent events a notion for which probability theorists would later substitute the idea of independent identically distributed events see the entry on probabilistic causation in observed and unobserved collections of cases Further Reading The thesis with an introduction to the arguments can be found in Reichenbach Re statements and slight variations of the arguments in the thesis can also be found in Reichenbach c Reichenbach e and to a lesser extent in Reichenbach g and chapter of Reichenbach f A synopsis is also given in Padovani while Eberhardt provides a critical assessment of the thesis Reichenbach s allegiance to Kantian formulations waxed and waned and transformed over time but while the terminology changed Reichenbach long retained the essential claim of his doctoral thesis that the establishment of any empirical law requires a superempirical presupposition about probability In the argument and conclusions of the thesis were repeated with little qualification or variation in two essays The Physical Presuppositions of the Calculus of Probability and A Philosophical Critique of the Probability Calculus Again in Causality and Probability in Reichenbach reprises the claims of his doctoral thesis but substitutes the principle of induction that observed frequencies will continue to hold in new cases for the principle of probability The principle of induction is not given an explicitly a priori basis the possibility of which Reichenbach had come to doubt when studying with Einstein see Reichenbach f Instead it is justified by an uneasy mixture of loose convergence arguments foreshadowing the straight rule see below and psychological habit Without attribution he dismisses a conventionalist account of the principle of induction expressed in nearly Kantian terms as the principle of induction is not a statement about the physical world but merely constitutes an ordering principle of science He argues that such an account does not justify scientific preferences for simpler hypotheses g see Reichenbach vol II p Arbitrary convention could choose any scientific hypothesis that captures the phenomena but a descriptively accurate account of theory selection in science must explain why simpler theories should be preferred The justification of the preference for simpler hypotheses remains unexplained in Causality and Probability and Reichenbach s own conclusion seems to be essentially the Kantian principle he rejects supplemented with an attempt to prove that the principle of induction is unchallengeable because in his view probability claims are generalizations over as yet unobserved cases and therefore presuppose the principle of induction In a further break with the Kantian tradition the role of causation as conceptually primitive is reconsidered It is difficult to pinpoint Reichenbach s position between and since his writings mix epistemic and metaphysical issues In his thesis b and in Stetige Wahrscheinlichkeitsfolgen L Reichenbach is committed to individual deterministic causal events In The Causal Structure of the World d probability is regarded as the more fundamental concept In later years Reichenbach often cited this paper as an anticipation of the indeterminism of quantum theory because his account allows the possibility that finer and finer measures will not converge to deterministic laws see Gerner p In Causality and Probability g causality explicitly refers to regularities in populations rather than to particular events a view whose source Reichenbach attributes to Ludwig Boltzmann s development of the theory of gases The separation of causality and probability and the recasting of causality as a higher level concept required that Reichenbach find a new foundation for probability Presumably due to the influence of his colleague Richard von Mises Reichenbach moved towards a view of probability as a property of sequences Reichenbach s essay The Causal Structure of the World d is also an early attempt to account for the direction of time in terms of causal and probabilistic asymmetries Reichenbach there introduces the notion of a probability implication with axiom schemes on propositional variables involving both material implication and a new place probability implication connective The axioms are evidently meant to supplement those of propositional logic No rules of inference are specified but substitution and modus ponens are used The axioms do not guarantee that a probability implication a b is the conditional probability of b given a or even that the consequents of a collection of probability implications with a as antecedent satisfy the axioms of finite probability Interpretation is difficult since Reichenbach both asserts that the probability of the consequent in a probability implication can be between and inclusive d vol II p but then disallows a probability implication because the consequent has probability p Reichenbach s thought seems to be that a b asserts that in circumstance a b has a well defined probability that is a specifies something like what Ian Hacking later called a chance setup or as Reichenbach might have put it implies the existence of a probability function for b b Reichenbach uses the operation very much in that way in his discussion of the direction of time which he thinks can be founded on cases in which a b is true but b a is false Even under this reading some of his axiom schemes have false instances e g a b a c b where the dot is ordinary conjunction The claim that b has a probability distribution in context a does not necessarily imply that b has a probability distribution in context a conjoined with context c since c might make a distribution impossible Revised probability implication later became a foundational notion of Reichenbach s theory of probability and the central concept of his approach to inductive logic Further Reading For Reichenbach s views on causality see also the discussion of The Direction of Time below and the separate entry on Reichenbach s Common Cause Principle Reichenbach continued to revise and elaborate his ideas about probability in a series of papers in the early s until in his The Theory of Probability provided a fuller statement of his developed view Surprisingly Reichenbach does not acknowledge help from Richard von Mises his colleague in Berlin and Istanbul in the period and the mathematician whose views on the foundations of probability were closest to his own and are often discussed in the book He does attribute part of the mathematical work in the book to Valentine Bargmann who after finishing his doctorate in physics in Berlin fled to Switzerland in and later became an assistant to von Neumann and to Einstein at the Institute for Advanced Study from where in the s he also assisted Reichenbach s work on quantum theory It is fair to say that The Theory of Probability was not well received drawing intense criticism from Karl Popper who had read Reichenbach s papers presenting a frequentist interpretation of probability C I Lewis Bertrand Russell and Ernest Nagel Kolmogorov s measure theoretic axioms for probability which appeared in soon overshadowed Reichenbach s formulation of the theory of probability The Theory of Probability uses class terms A B C and individual variables x y z as well as real variables p q u r w Distinct individual variables are unnecessarily sometimes and sometimes not associated with distinct class names but Reichenbach s formulae without iterated probability conditionals can be read as universally quantified with a single individual variable The earlier axiom schemes for probability implication d are replaced by axiom schemes expressed in Reichenbach s abbreviated form as f p Reichenbach s intent with formula I is to say that where it exists the probability has a unique value Axiom II is meant to ensure that the probabilities conditional on a nonempty set have values between and inclusive Axiom III is Reichenbach s version of the requirement that the probability of the union of mutually exclusive events is the sum of their probabilities Axiom IV is essentially the chain rule of probability P CB A P C BA P B A Axiom I is implicit in the Kolmogorov axioms see Section Kolmogorov s Probability Calculus in the entry on interpretations of probability since probability is taken to be a real valued function Axiom II corresponds to Kolmogorov s first and second axioms that probability values are bounded between and inclusive Axiom III amounts to finite additivity because Reichenbach s logic does not have infinite disjunctions it is a finite restriction of Kolmogorov s third axiom which postulates additivity of probabilities for countable even infinite disjoint sets Axiom IV at least its interpretation in terms of the chain rule follows from Kolmorogov s first three axioms Reichenbach requires it as an additional axiom because of his mixture of logical and mathematical notation Without the additional fourth axiom Reichenbach could not switch between logical conjunction and mathematical multiplication Reichenbach proceeds to show that finite frequencies satisfy his four axioms He construes all probabilities as frequencies of sub series in a larger series or what is the same thing for finite sets cardinalities of subsets in a universal set Hence his probabilities are always with respect to a non empty reference class so the probability that an event is in a class B is in Reichenbach s notation P A B where A is the reference class similar to the modern notation of the conditional probability P B A But the probability logic axioms are so weak that many formal structures satisfy them and Reichenbach s claim is a long way from a representation theorem He fails to provide the additional constraints on the space that probabilities are applied to which in Kolmogorov s case are given by the assumption that the space is a sigma field i e a field closed under complementation and countable union Reichenbach s official definition of probability for infinite sequence pairs xi yi with xi in A and yi in B for which the limit p of the relative frequency of B in A exists is as follows the limit p is called the probability from A to B within the sequence pair f p Constraints on the nature of the sequences are added later f section that are aimed to formalize aspects of randomness Probabilities of single cases are fictive or elliptical to be understood as claims about the frequency of a kind of case in an implicit reference class Elsewhere Reichenbach puts more emphasis on finite frequencies and even suggests that limiting frequencies are simply a mathematical device for justifying inductive procedures A letter to B Russell vol II p Once introduced the logical framework is dropped in the mathematical development of probability theory in the book In combination with the representation of probability relations by claims in a quasilogical language the limiting frequency interpretation creates fundamental formal problems that Reichenbach did not foresee Sets of limiting relative frequencies are not closed under finite intersection they are not closed under countable union they do not satisfy countable additivity They do not in other words form a sigma field or a Borel field or even a field See the entries on interpretations of probability the early development of set theory and set theory These and several other mathematical difficulties of Reichenbach s setup are described in van Fraassen Reichenbach imposes two further axioms the axioms of order f p that are supposed to hold necessarily of limiting frequencies for infinite time series One is trivial essentially asserting that a conditional frequency on lags Reichenbach s term for lags is phases of a constant variable can always be replaced by a conditional frequency on no lag of that variable The second however appears to be a very strong stationarity principle that is not generally true the probability of one variable conditional on a specified common lag of other variables is invariant under all uniform translations of the lags This axiom seems to derive directly from Reichenbach s interpretation of the foundations of probability in particular from Reichenbach s assumption about normal sequences described below In addition to an axiomatization Reichenbach attempts to provide a foundation for probability claims in terms of properties of sequences similar to von Mises Reichenbach regarded von Mises attempt von Mises at formally characterizing a random sequence as a failure and instead attempted to characterize a weaker sequence property a normal sequence In his account of normal sequences Reichenbach retains although the second only in a weaker form two features that are deemed essential for random sequences the lack of after effect and the invariance of the limiting relative frequency under subsequence selection Informally the invariance under subsequence selection is supposed to capture the idea that the probabilities of events in any infinite subsequence selected from the original sequence by a procedure based on the indices of events in the original sequence alone will be the same as the probabilities of events in the original sequence The lack of aftereffect is supposed to capture the idea that given any initial segment of a sequence one cannot predict the probability of the next event any better than predicting it based on the limiting relative frequency of events in the infinite sequence Reichenbach s definition of lack of aftereffect is not based on initial segments of sequences but rather on subsequences selected by a particular set of rules f p Reichenbach defines a selection S as any rule that determines for each member of a sequence whether it is a member of S p He intends by a rule literally any subsequence We are unable to reconstruct exactly what Reichenbach may have intended in particular since his definition of lack of aftereffect is difficult to distinguish from the criterion of invariance under subsequence selection But we believe it is something close to the following A sequence of Bi is free from aftereffect if i a subsequence is selected based on a rule of the form For each index i in the sequence include the i k th element in the sequence if the ith element is B or B ii if the subsequence thus selected has the same event probabilities as the original sequence and iii if this holds for all lags k If our reconstruction is correct this would distinguish Reichenbach s account of lack of aftereffect from that of invariance under subsequence selection because the former includes subsequence selection rules that depend on the values of certain items in the sequence while the latter includes only rules that are based on the indices Two more definitions are required for the full picture First a selection S of a subsequence of sequence A belongs to the domain of invariance of B if the probability of B for all lags in S is unchanged from the probability of B in A and if the same holds for any selection S from A with a lag Second a subsequence selected by an algebraic rule that partitions the sequence A e g take every fourth element see p for details is called a regular division of A Putting the pieces together Reichenbach requires for the normality of a sequence A that it be free of aftereffect and that all regular divisions of A are in the domain of invariance of B This condition of regular divisions seems to underlie the stationarity expressed in the second axiom of order If random sequences are taken to satisfy at least the conditions of the lack of aftereffect and invariance of subsequence selection under any selection rule then Reichenbach s restriction of subsequence selection rules to regular divisions implies that the set of normal sequences is a proper superset of that of random sequences Reichenbach accepts this weakening to avoid some of the difficulties in characterizing a random sequence and to broaden his earlier notions of probability to include sequences of trials which might not be perfectly independent In later writings he seems to suggest that as long as the sequence converges probability claims can be applied to the component events A large section of the book is devoted to reconstructing classical results in the theory of probability as claims about relative frequencies including various continuous distributions and Bernoulli s theorem Reichenbach claims that probabilities on continuous domains are isomorphic to limiting relative frequencies but as van Fraassen notes it is difficult to see any sense in which that is true The remainder of the book is not about probability per se but about its epistemological role Further Reading A detailed attempt at the reconstruction of Reichenbach s account of probability and its epistemological grounding can be found in Eberhardt Glymour which includes specific references to the original sources The first half of R dei Gyenis provides a very useful discussion of why Reichenbach s axioms do not fit well with measure theoretic accounts of probability Hubert pinpoints several of the challenges with Reichenbach s frequentist account and develops his own solution Reichenbach began his philosophical career as a neo Kantian a perspective that is evident in his thesis and in his first book length effort f after his doctoral thesis and that at least echoes in his later work The aim of The Theory of Relativity and A Priori Knowledge is to reconcile Kantian theory in a limited way with the theory of relativity by distinguishing two senses of synthetic a priori Principles governing the content of experience can be synthetic a priori because they are necessary transcendental truths or because they are non empirical principles that form part of how we construct our representation of reality and are thus revisable Reichenbach endorses the latter constitutive sense of the synthetic a priori and sees his task as scrutinizing Kant s principles in light of the new reality described in the theory of relativity Reichenbach s never clearly specified process of a construction of a representation is hidden behind the idea of coordination Particular principles such as those of causality or probability are supposed to establish a correspondence between something in experience and our representation of it in the form of a mathematically axiomatized scientific theory la Hilbert What that something is Reichenbach never clearly describes He explicitly rejects the proposal that it is just sensation and he admits that what he is describing is a curious case of the coordination of two sets of which one set s elements are first defined through the coordination p a While a priori in the constitutive sense the coordination principles are contingent they could be changed if experience makes others more convenient The picture is very much like that C I Lewis offers at about the same time in Mind and the World Order Reichenbach s account of the ascension from sense data to individual things to scientific theories is via an account of testing in spirit close to ideas that Hermann Weyl and Rudolf Carnap were later to advance in which various hypotheses support one another each functioning as an auxiliary in tests of others an idea Glymour later unsuccessfully tried to formalize as bootstrapping The foundational character of sense data and the view that objects and their properties and relations are constructions endures for some years in Reichenbach s thought for example in his essay on The Aims and Methods of Physical Knowledge g where however the example and authority is no longer Kant s first Critique but rather Russell s Our Knowledge of the External World and Carnap s The Logical Structure of the World By the late s Reichenbach was moving away from neo Kantian positions and towards logical positivist views allying himself with the Vienna Circle philosophers although he always maintained and emphasized in retrospect that the empiricist philosophy he pursued in the Berlin Group was much more focused and engaged with science and did not fall prey to the positivist problems that came out of attempts to ground knowledge on sense data alone He did not view his contemporaries uniformly For Moritz Schlick Reichenbach seems to have had a somewhat condescending respect for Ludwig Wittgenstein who is one of the few philosophers whom he later criticizes by name in Experience and Prediction c and for Karl Popper none whatsoever Aside from Einstein his deepest respect and closest intellectual alliances seem to have been with Kurt Lewin Kurt Grelling Rudolf Carnap Richard von Mises although they do not seem to have got along personally and Bertrand Russell although Reichenbach was not pleased with Russell s criticism of his views in Russell s last philosophical book Human Knowledge Its Scope and Limits Russell see Reichenbach vol II p Further Reading Chapter of Ryckman provides a very clear attempt at reconstructing Reichenbach s struggle with Kantian principles in the s Padovani provides a wealth of textual detail and references for the same period with a more focused notion of Reichenbach s notion of coordination in Padovani Chapter of Milmed traces the Kantian elements in Reichenbach s epistemology and discusses the conflicts that arise though the analysis concerns primarily Reichenbach s mature views By the s Reichenbach abandoned foundationalism altogether and adopted an epistemological position closer to pragmatism than to logical positivism Reichenbach s mature viewpoint presented in Experience and Prediction c diminishes the status of the given knowledge belief and conjecture is built around his conceptions of meaning probability and convention Coordination of language and physical circumstances replaces his earlier coordination of Kantian concepts and sensation Reichenbach is a realist about the external world but asserts that we can only have uncertain knowledge about it inferred from sense data Deliberation can reject the gifts of perception so involuntarily received Claims about ordinary objects and scientific claims about other kinds of objects whether sense data or atoms are probabilistic in nature and related by probabilities not by any kind of logical reduction Reichenbach was not alone in this view at the time In in the second issue of Analysis Hempel writing in English because Carnap could not at the time described Carnap s viewpoint in similar if not quite identical antifoundationalist terms The overall account seems to be something like the following Language requires a coordination of words or at least sentences with something signified Scientific language Reichenbach claims requires coordinative definitions that specify physical procedures for measurement A common example is the definition of the Paris meter bar as a unit of distance Definitions in the usual sense occur within a language but Reichenbach sometimes appears to intend something like an ostensive definition he does not use the term He gives no account of how such an act can suffice to specify a rule and he recognizes instances in which it does not for example that a coordination that measures time by the behavior of clocks does not suffice to provide a rule for deciding relations of time measurements between distant clocks Various coordinative definitions may thus leave measures of other quantities or relations indeterminate and these must be specified by some stipulation or other His chief but not only example is the definition of simultaneity see also Rynasiewicz and Dieks for a clear discussion Once specifications of all relevant quantities are made empirical claims are possible There are in Reichenbach s view two related ambiguities First different stipulations about measurement can lead to apparently different empirical generalizations that nevertheless are empirically indistinguishable although just what empirically indistinguishable can consistently mean for Reichenbach is problematic for reasons to be noted Second the same total theory may be partitioned in more than one way into claims true by stipulation and empirical claims Reichenbach s solution to these forms of underdetermination is that equivalent theories say the same thing The equivalence relation he intends is unclear In earlier writings he suggests that empirically equivalent theories are those that have the same empirically testable consequences a later formulation is that empirically equivalent theories are those that have the same posterior probability on any observations The later characterization is as clear as Reichenbach s characterization of the probability of theories and their confirmation see below The earlier characterization results in a semantics for which no effective proof theory is possible Glymour One puzzle about Reichenbach s view of conventions is why characterizing them remained important to him since they are in his mature view only a feature of the reconstruction of a theory not an intrinsic logical or semantical feature of any proposition In principle separating out different presentations of the same theory and recognizing equivalence amid diverse conventions might be of value but except in cases such as simultaneity and gravitational theories with extra absolute forces Reichenbach did not use reconstruction to that effect and the most important question of equivalence in the physics of his era the relation of wave and matrix mechanics was solved in a quite different way by John von Neumann Reichenbach s emphasis on locating conventions seems instead to be negatively motivated a continuing prophylactic against claims that various principles are a priori The immediate description of the perceptual world is in terms of enduring objects their properties and relationships and that description is only probable The world can be described egocentrically in terms of impressions and sense data but Reichenbach argues ordinary descriptions of things are not equivalent to egocentric descriptions in terms of impressions because however elaborate egocentric formulations do not entail object claims they only confer a probability on object descriptions and of course in parallel given Reichenbach s anti foundationalism egocentric descriptions are only probable The argument is not in accord with Reichenbach s own criterion for equivalent descriptions but the conclusion is repeatedly emphasized Reichenbach insists sometimes in rather sharp language that the logical positivists and unnamed pretentious logicians are simply wrong about locating the foundations of knowledge in sense data or analytical truths Reichenbach s mature views on the notion of analytic truth were complex He no longer held with C I Lewis that there is at any time any sort of Kantian a priori but there is synonymy there are equivalent descriptions and the assertion of equivalence between equivalent descriptions is presumably a purely logical matter hence analytic Although explicitly addressed to Carnap C I Lewis was quite possibly an equal target of Quine s Two Dogmas of Empiricism As Quine s senior at Harvard Lewis was unlikely to be criticized by name In a brief essay on Logical Positivism in Russell gently but pointedly ridiculed Carnap s disposition to resolve every apparently irresolvable dispute by appeal to linguistic relativism Russell s criticism and Nelson Goodman s criticism of the very idea of synonymy Goodman but perhaps not Quine s could have been applied to Reichenbach All empirical claims are according to Reichenbach probabilistic judgments based on relative frequencies in a reference class or reached by induction To the extent that reference classes rely on kinds Reichenbach resorts to psychology primarily things are sorted into kinds by the immediate perception of similarity or by similarity in memory Less primitively theory and convention guide the determination of kinds In practice he recommends the choice of the narrowest reference class for which there are adequate statistics a recommendation that is of no help why or why not should we throw various astrological theories into the reference class for assessing the prior probability of general relativity Primary or fundamental inductive inference consists of taking observed relative frequencies as probabilities that is as limiting relative frequencies This procedure referred to as the straight rule implies that one should take the current empirical distribution to resemble the limiting distribution and therefore behave accordingly The justification of such taking or positing in Reichenbach s terminology is that if there is a limiting relative frequency to a sequence this procedure will converge to it Reichenbach notes in The Theory of Probability f that without further assumptions nothing can be said about rates of convergence or about the warranted confidence that an empirical distribution has converged He further acknowledges that any procedure that estimates the probability to be the relative frequency plus any quantity that keeps the estimate between and and that itself converges to will also converge to the limiting frequency if such exists He there misleadingly treats such alternative inductive rules as producing equivalent descriptions to the straight rule and takes the choice as of no consequence but of course the equivalence is only in the limit In Experience and Prediction c he instead dismisses such alternative rules on the vague grounds that they are riskier than the straight rule The proposal of the straight rule goes back to the problem of assertability of probability claims he discussed in his thesis Reichenbach s proposal is reminiscent of the law of large numbers that the empirical distribution of a sequence of independent and identically distributed trials converges in probability to the true distribution But the law of large numbers depends on independent identically distributed trials Reichenbach cannot resort to such assumptions if he wants to avoid circularity in his account of inductive inference Instead he introduces posits that can basically be understood as leaps of tentative faith that the empirical distribution is representative Posits can be blind or appraised Posits are blind when there is no data available to justify the posit For example if all one has is a sequence of measurements for which the empirical frequency distribution of events is given by F then a blind posit might state that the probabilities specified by F are within for some small of the true distribution P One has no reason to justify this claim the posit is blind However if one had several sequences of measurements resulting in empirical frequency distributions F Fn then the relative frequencies found in each of these empirical distributions can according to Reichenbach be used to get higher order distributional information about the original posit itself and the posit therefore becomes appraised So if one has sequences of measurements of the gravitational constant from the Earth the Moon the other planets and say the Cavendish balance sequences in total and in all cases except for Mercury the gravitational constant is within some small value of g then the higher order probability of the posit that the true value of the gravitational constant is within of g is How sure can one be that the appraisal of the posit is accurate For that Reichenbach introduces again an even higher order blind posit One thus arrives at a hierarchy of posits of which the lower levels are appraised posits and the highest levels are blind posits Just how the integration of different levels is supposed to occur remains unclear and a point of criticism by Ernest Nagel see below The general idea appears to be that at the data level one counts frequencies and integrates higher levels using Bayes rule The approach of estimating higher order distributional information on the basis of subdividing the available sample is similar to the modern statistical procedure of bootstrapping although there re sampling techniques are used Reichenbach argues that his procedure ensures more efficient convergence than does na ve application of the straight rule alone Faster convergence of the first level estimate the data level is somehow supposed to result from simultaneous convergence at all the different levels in this hierarchy of appraised posits Reichenbach refers to this as the method of cross induction But Creary Ch points out that there is no reading of such a conclusion about efficient convergence that follows from the premises Reichenbach assumes though see Schurz for a more recent take Over time and place the reasons Reichenbach gives for convergence of frequency estimates to a limiting value vary including his early view that convergence is synthetic a priori or that the principle of induction expresses a kind of psychological habit the semantic argument we quoted above in Section that the negation of the principle of induction is meaningless a pragmatic vindication that induction using the straight rule works if any method of induction works a convergence argument based on higher order probabilities or that there is no guarantee merely posits The probability associated with any foundational claim must be understood as a blind posit i e as a good guess which according to Reichenbach can take into account pragmatic considerations Thus Reichenbach posits the existence of the external world as he thought it would make causal laws more homogenous c In a rather mixed metaphor Reichenbach compares our knowledge of the external world to seeing shadows of flying birds on the walls of a cube in which one is confined He argues that the patterns on the walls their regularity would result in a high probability that there are objects outside the cube producing the shadows Reichenbach s eventual anti foundationalism led him to a contest of opinions with C I Lewis whose accounts of empirical learning and reasoning in Mind and the World Order and in An Analysis of Knowledge and Valuation rested on a phenomenalist foundation of qualia see the entry on qualia Lewis like Reichenbach a probabilist at heart insisted that the assessment and revision of probabilities in the light of experience requires that some propositions obtained from experience be certain or as he put it if anything is probable something must be certain Reichenbach denied the claim arguing that the deliverances of experience directly provide not certainty for claims about qualia but only probabilities for claims about ordinary things Those probabilities can be revised in the light of further experience For the same reason in his unremittingly critical review of Karl Popper s The Logic of Scientific Discovery Popper Reichenbach argues that probability assessments are essential in the falsification of theories e vol p Lewis actual complaint appears to be based on a mathematical error when computing conditional probabilities Reichenbach pointed out Lewis error but did not provide a positive example to refute Lewis concern Peijnenburg Atkinson A more general problem that appears to have been missed in the discussion at the time is that since Reichenbach held that the probabilities of theories are to be assessed by Bayes rule his position unlike Lewis required a technical account of how claims with non extremal probabilities can produce changes in the probabilities of others by some generalization of Bayes rule see the entry on Bayes Theorem Since on Reichenbach s view uncertainty is associated with observation and perception and scientific theories are only confirmed with a degree of probability an account is required of how uncertain data changes the probabilities of hypotheses logically remote from the data Much later Richard Jeffrey provided an account of Bayesian updating that explicitly relates the probability of the data to the probability of the hypothesis confirmed or disconfirmed by the data see the entry on Bayesian epistemology Bayes rule and the probabilities of theories posed another problem pressed on Reichenbach by Ernest Nagel in a review in Mind of the German edition of Reichenbach s The Theory of Probability Nagel see also Nagel Nagel s courteous review found a series of difficulties with Reichenbach s theory beginning with the logical status of the probability implication which Nagel thought was not contrary to Reichenbach of the same kind as material implication because Reichenbach s relation is not extensional Nagel does not explain what he means and Reichenbach s extended response in does not clarify the matter b vol p In his response to Popper e Reichenbach had proposed two ways of evaluating theories one of which is to count the relative frequency of true statements among the consequences of a theory Nagel points out that a theory of whose tested predictions are false would scarcely have probability Reichenbach does not attempt to defend this proposal in his reply to Nagel in Reichenbach a That leaves the assignment of probabilities to theories by Bayes Rule which Reichenbach had also proposed but Nagel observes that if theories are to be evaluated by Bayes rule they must have prior probabilities How can there be a frequentist prior probability for a theory since we do not know to what reference class to assign a particular theory and whatever the reference class according to Reichenbach we do not and cannot know which theories in that class are true As in several of his other responses to criticism Reichenbach s reply is unfortunately more defensive than enlightening About the reference class Reichenbach says only I do not think this is a serious difficulty as the same question occurs for the determination of the probability of single events and recommends the choice of the narrowest reference class for which there are adequate statistics though how the adequacy of a statistic for the truth or falsity of theories is assessed is never explained Reichenbach gave a sketch of such a procedure in his reply to Popper which Nagel pointedly does not think addresses the problems About the problem of the frequency of true hypotheses in the reference class Reichenbach says that we only need the probabilities of theories in the reference class not their truth or falsity a question begging reply that Reichenbach must have sensed is unconvincing because he promises to address the issue further in Experience and Prediction c The discussion of the prior probabilities of theories in section of Experience and Prediction is unsatisfactory for the same reasons Reichenbach s most enduring distinction is between the context of discovery and the context of justification But Reichenbach did not always allow the distinction and the distinction he intended is not quite the one commonly attributed to him In his essay on The Philosophical Significance of the Theory of Relativity c the now conventional distinction between the context of discovery and the context of justification is formulated in other terms and rejected In his review Reichenbach e of Popper s The Logic of Scientific Discovery Reichenbach suggests that theories are ordered by their prior probability and the theory with the highest prior is further tested In Experience and Prediction c and in his reply to Nagel Reichenbach a published in the same year Reichenbach first formulates the distinction between the context of discovery and the context of justification with regard to mathematics the mathematical relations are what they are and how we come to recognize them is an entirely different psychological matter In other words the distinction is supposed to be between objective relations among premises and conclusions and subjective ways of discovering those relations The context of discovery is not about search for hypotheses or about the order in which hypotheses are considered but about the search for the objective inductive relation between a theory and a body of evidence What little Reichenbach had to say publicly about how to search for promising hypotheses was reported in his review of Popper s book and in his dismissal in his reply to Nagel of Peirce s abduction as a confusion of mathematical and psychological relations While Carnap later imagined an inductive logically omniscient robot Carnap and Hempel much later in Thoughts on the Limitations of Discovery by Computer Hempel claimed that computerized generation of interesting scientific hypotheses is impossible Reichenbach seems not to have given any thought to questions about how to come up with hypotheses and about better and worse ways to search through the space of logically possible theories He had one fundamental procedure for estimating true hypotheses the straight rule and one secondary procedure whose application he never coherently explained Bayes rule with objective frequentist prior probabilities for hypotheses Further Reading Putnam provides a helpful big picture of Reichenbach s mature views on metaphysics and epistemology Chapter of Milmed provides an overview of Reichenbach s probabilistic epistemology and views on induction Salmon in various papers see the entry on the problem of induction tried in vain to save the straight rule Reichenbach s pragmatic vindication of induction see also Hacking Eberhardt Glymour try to reconstruct the details of Reichenbach s probability logic and discuss some of the criticism leveled at Reichenbach s account in more detail Fetzer and H yek focus on the reference class problem Psillos disentangles Reichenbach s argument for realism Galavotti provides a succinct attempt at reconstructing a coherent overall account of Reichenbach s epistemology Chapter of Milmed provides one of the few good discussions of Reichenbach s views on logic An entire collection of articles in Schickore Steinle explores the different interpretations historical connections and philosophical offspring of Reichenbach s distinction of the context of discovery and the context of justification Almost exclusively Reichenbach s scientific interest was in physics He regarded chemistry as an appendage entirely reducible to physics and his only publication touching the subject is on Marcelin Bertholot Reichenbach a the eminent French anti vitalist chemist Of biology Reichenbach leaves open at least in the serious possibility that life exhibits phenomena that cannot be explained by physical laws and of evolution he remarks that it has disappointed in failing to explain the problem of life g Section He believed Freud s psychoanalytic theories were scientifically warranted by Freud s evidence and in Los Angeles maintained friendships in the psychoanalytic community including attending and sometimes lecturing at the Psychoanalytic Institute As a student Reichenbach showed some interest in psychology Padovani p however except for brief passages in Experience and Prediction c Reichenbach published nothing about psychology and we have no evidence regarding how familiar he was with Freud s publications It seems unlikely that Reichenbach knew Freud s remarkably candid descriptions before of his aggressive data collection procedures and of course Freud s letters to Wilhelm Fleiss Masson which reveal how little Freud thought of his own methodology were unknown to Reichenbach Reichenbach s most original work on the foundations of physics is in three books Axiomatization of the Theory of Relativity h Philosophical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics b and The Direction of Time b The first attempts an empiricist aufbau of the special and in less detail general theories of relativity from experimentally accessible causal relationships the second essays a novel valued logic for quantum theory and the third addresses a long standing problem in physics and metaphysics The Philosophy of Space and Time h Reichenbach s most widely read most elegant and least original work on physics combines an extension to spacetime theories of Helmholtz s and Poincar s conventionalism about geometry with a description of Einstein s special and general relativity theories from the point of view of the Axiomatization much of which it repeats Einstein s lectures on relativity in Berlin in attended at the time by Reichenbach and a handful of others provided a shock to Reichenbach s viewpoint The Theory of Relativity and A Priori Knowledge published in is an attempt to identify neo Kantian doctrines that must be abandoned and to articulate what can be salvaged Twenty five years before in his dissertation published in Russell had undertaken a similar project in connection with non Euclidean geometry arguing that constant curvature is the geometrical synthetic a priori In Poincar s Science and Hypothesis essentially supplemented Russell s view with the opinion that the choice of constant curvature geometry is underdetermined the choice of one such geometry rather than another can always be compensated by a change of physics to save the phenomena Without mentioning Russell or Helmholtz Reichenbach takes general relativity to have refuted both Poincar s geometrical conventionalism and Kant s geometrical apriorism Most of the book addresses general epistemological issues discussed above rather than issues about physics per se Between the publication of The Theory of Relativity and A Priori Knowledge in and the appearance of The Axiomatization of the Theory of Relativity in Reichenbach published a series of professional and popular essays expounding or defending the special and general theories and Reichenbach s own axiomatization which was published in outline in in Physikalische Zeitschrift d The professional essays were variously addressed to audiences of philosophers or physicists They are interesting for our purposes chiefly because they state philosophical positions that Reichenbach had previously rejected or would later come to reject or because they offer interpretations of the theories that are problematic Notable in the last respect is Reichenbach s view that general covariance is a substantive claim of general relativity the laws of physics have the same form in every coordinate system and frame of reference Reichenbach does not explain the idea of the form of a physical law While Kantian perspectives the a priori constitution of the object still linger the Philosophical Significance of the Theory of Relativity published in French in signals a break with some of Reichenbach s previous views c Perhaps influenced by Einstein s Geometry and Experience Reichenbach no longer holds that contrary to the conventionalist views he attributes to Helmholtz and Poincar the theory of relativity has established a geometry as part of physics to which there can be no empirically adequate alternative After introducing the idea of a universal force affecting all objects no matter how insulated and noting that gravitation as usually conceived is such a force Reichenbach writes that The solution to the problem of space is found only in this conception we call conventionalism which goes back to Helmholtz and Poincar Reichenbach p The idea that empirically indistinguishable hypotheses differ only verbally equivalent descriptions in Reichenbach s terminology is already developed here In the s Einstein and Herman Weyl each sought a field theory that would unify gravitation and electrodynamics Reichenbach took part chiefly in criticizing both Weyl s and Einstein s efforts The onus of his criticism was that mathematical elegance is an insufficient guide the fundamental quantities of a theory should be measurable indeed have coordinating definitions In his view field theories whose fundamental quantity is an affine connection did not Giovanelli provides an insightful account of the exchanges on this topic among Einstein Reichenbach and Weyl In Reichenbach published a very limited pr cis of the approach to the theory of relativity he ultimately presented in Reichenbach d The Axiomatization is either a work very much out of its time or the times have not changed much Reichenbach s statement of purpose might have been written at any time in the last quarter of the th century in response to Quine s holism and to Thomas Kuhn s incommensurability thesis see the entries on belief and on Thomas Kuhn It is not easy to arrive at a judgment with respect to the axioms of a theory Usually the axioms representing higher levels of abstraction are quite remote from direct sense perception In order to avoid this difficulty It is possible to start with the observable facts and to end with the abstract conceptualization The empirical character of the axioms about observables is immediately evident and it is easy to see what consequences follow from their respective confirmations or disconfirmations Unfortunately every factual statement even the simplest one contains more than an immediate perceptual experience it is already an interpretation and therefore itself a theory The most elementary factual statements therefore contain some measure of theory Does there exist any confirmation other than that of the theory as a whole Let us assume that the theory by means of which we explain a certain fact is false and is to be replaced by a different one It is nevertheless possible that the new theory when used for the interpretation of this one fact makes hardly any difference quantitatively whereas it leads to considerable changes with respect to other assertions The new theory has merely to satisfy the requirement that it will not result in a practically noticeable quantitative difference when applied to these elementary facts For this reason all axioms of our presentation have been chosen in such a way that they can be derived from the experiments by means of pre relativistic optics and mechanics All are facts that can be tested without the use of the theory of relativity The particular factual statements of the theory of relativity can all be grasped by means of pre relativistic conceptions only their combination within the conceptual system is new p The book is divided into two parts one on special relativity and the other on general relativity each in some respects dependent on the other The first part presents a series of postulates about the behavior of light accompanied by a series of definitions The primitives are a directed acyclic graph whose vertices are point events and whose edges represent the relation a signal can be sent from event A and received at point B and a partitioning of the event space by assignment of each event to a point on some real line intuitively a world line such that the set of events assigned to the same line are equicardinal with the line and their ordering by signaling is the ordering of the real line and such that no two such world lines intersect Axioms about the behavior of signals especially first signals meaning light signals are intended to specify sufficient constraints so that the coordination determines an inertial frame of reference in Minkowski space time Extensive discussion is given over to the impossibility of experimentally determining a metrical simultaneity relation that is of finding experimentally a unique simultaneity space for an inertially moving observer Matter axioms are then added specifying transport properties of rigid rods and the connection of rigid rod distance measurements with round trip time measurements although one of the matter axioms Axiom VI is entirely about clock transport Reichenbach asserts that the four matter axioms that are restricted to inertial frames follow from his light axioms That is not true and pages later Reichenbach qualifies the claim to mean only that the relations follow from the general theory of relativity Reichenbach very briefly discusses the classical tests of the general theory of relativity the red shift of light emitted from the sun the bending of starlight passing near the limb of the sun and the anomalous advance of the perihelion of Mercury He summarizes only the deflection of light and the red shift can furnish evidence for Einstein s relation between gravitation and the real metric p A far more enlightening analysis of the bearing of the classical tests had been given by Harold Jeffreys in and taken over without acknowledgement by Arthur Eddington in The Mathematical Theory of Relativity Eddington Jeffreys s approach eventually led to the modern parameterization of metrical theories of gravitation The Axiomatization has three difficulties It contains a mathematical error discovered by John von Neumann in the proof that two frames of reference satisfying his five light postulates and definitions could not have a world line at rest in common Reichenbach acknowledged the error in and again in without proposing any modification to obtain uniqueness In an unflattering review Herman Weyl gave a second reason Weyl see also Rynasiewicz the light cone structure of Minkowski space time does not suffice to specify a unique set of inertial frames unaccelerated with respect to one another and hence neither do Reichenbach s axioms By introducing a singularity in the infinite past a system of accelerated frames can be used Weyl took this fact to defeat the very purpose of Reichenbach s attempted reconstruction of the theories to found them on observable relationships But perhaps the most important problem is that much of Reichenbach s construction without the philosophical commentary had been anticipated by A A Robb first in A Theory of Time and Space and then in The Absolute Relations of Time and Space for both special and general relativity Reichenbach does not mention Robb in or to our knowledge later even though Robb s book was reissued with a different title in Reichenbach s apparent unfamiliarity at the time with the English language literature on relativity is notable and unfortunate He cites only one essentially English language source from The American Journal of Mathematics and seems not to know of the work of Jeffreys or Robb He does appear to have read Eddington s paper on Weyl s theory Whatever the cause the Axiomatization which is one of Reichenbach s most original technical efforts would have been a different work or none at all had he taken account of those developments Further Reading Section of Ryckman provides a more detailed analysis of what Reichenbach was trying to do in this book Dieks contrasts Reichenbach s and Weyl s foundations of space and time Published only years after the Axiomatization The Philosophy of Space and Time h is an engaging unification of a multitude of ideas Reichenbach had previously published including the distinction between descriptive and inductive simplicity the synonymy of equivalent descriptions the distinction between differential and universal forces the necessity of coordinating definitions and their conventionality the conventionality of spatial metrics and of metrical simultaneity and the account of the logical structure of relativity theories in terms of properties of causal relations in the Axiomatization The introduction to The Philosophy of Space and Time betrays the Marxist inclinations Reichenbach retained from his student years Science he says has become mechanized and develops so rapidly and automatically that its practitioners cannot reflect on what they are doing or why He might as well have said they are alienated from their labor but he did not A philosophical counterweight he might as well have said antithesis but he did not is needed The counterweight cannot be provided by individuals announcing philosophical manifestos it requires that philosophers organize into groups so that collectively they can keep up with and exercise analytic control over the products of the scientific machine The Vienna Circle and Reichenbach s own group of philosophers and physicists in Berlin are the models Together philosophers should produce results not manifestos This last demand was the conclusion of the editorial Reichenbach placed in the first issue of Erkenntnis in Reichenbach a Schlick and Carnap his collaborators in founding the journal refused to sign the editorial Schlick resigned entirely as an editor The book begins with a clear and compelling discussion of the interdependence of properties and laws illustrated through the relations of alternative measures of length and alternative geometries The examples are then used to make two general claims first that within the structure of complex theories there are identifiable points that are definitions and second that alternative systems of definitions and laws that account for the same facts say the same thing have the same content Reichenbach s definitions are not purely verbal they are coordinative definitions that specify physical procedures for determining the values of quantities The point is reinforced with a distinction between differential and universal forces Universal forces influence all objects in the same way where theory specifies what a way is and cannot be shielded against Heat for example is a differential force because it affects bodies of different compositions differently whereas gravity is a universal force A space with curvature can be equally described as a space without curvature but with a universal force Without explicit statement Reichenbach takes for granted the view later defended in Experience and Prediction c that talk in coordinative definitions about ordinary middle sized nearby physical objects and processes is intelligible and legitimate Reichenbach has a complex discussion of visualization He introduces Helmholtz s idea that to visualize a geometry is to understand what experiences one would have in a world in which that geometry holds and extends the idea to the visualization of spaces with compact topologies where Reichenbach argues Euclidean geometry could be sustained but at the cost of causal anomalies For example in a toroidal space travel on a geodesic would bring one back to one s starting point which Reichenbach argues would require either abandoning Euclid or else allowing causal anomalies in the form of duplicate worlds at regular distances from one another By Euclidean geometry Reichenbach means here a geometry on a manifold homeomorphic to R since there is a complete Euclidean metric for toroidal space Reichenbach gives other examples of causal anomalies but no general characterization Even with Helmholtz available Reichenbach is concerned to dispute further the very idea that Euclidean geometry has a privileged status in mathematical visualization that indicates some intrinsic limitation of thought If humans had somehow been transported to a non Euclidean world he says they would have non Euclidean visualizations surely a puzzling counterfactual The very idea that pure visualization has some normative content is a mistake he argues the normative function of visualization is not of visual but of logical origin p We do not presume to know just what Reichenbach meant here but for a plausible elucidation one might turn to recent philosophical work on the logical relations implicit in geometrical diagrams Reichenbach s discussion of space and time begins with a near irony Having argued against Kant s effort to justify the basics of Newtonian physics a priori Reichenbach proceeds to argue that we can know almost a priori that Newtonian theory is false For example Newton does not distinguish between the length of a moving segment and its length at rest but according to Reichenbach this is an a priori mistake the measurement of a segment with a measuring rod that moves relative to it requires the formulation of a new concept The length of a moving line segment is the distance between simultaneous positions of its endpoints p And further It follows from the nature of the extended concept of length that the length of a moving segment is generally different from its rest length To say which is the true length is nonsense p Thus is Newton refuted Most of the rest of the book is a restatement of the Axiomatization with more extended examples and fewer proofs and explicitly construed as a reduction of space time relations to causal relations supplemented with definitions The fundamental causal relation to which Reichenbach appeals must be asymmetric and allow reidentification of objects or their features Reichenbach thinks to obtain the asymmetry via a criterion of causation that invokes both the preservation of something material and the asymmetry of intervention A mark placed at the beginning of a causal process can be received at the end of the process Reichenbach s example is the color of a light signal The asymmetry is that if the beginning of the process is marked the end of the process bears the mark but if the end of the process is marked the beginning does not bear the mark The analysis thus depends on a distinction between observing a mark and the asymmetric relation of causing a mark Reichenbach recognizes that for his empiricist causal construction of the space metric signals must be reidentifiable a relation he notes that Kurt Lewin had discussed in his Habilitationsschrift as genidentity see also Padovani Unsurprisingly Reichenbach offers no guide to reidentification which is obtained in all cases including those of light signals from elaborate convictions or at least habits about all kinds of details and regularities of the world Had Reichenbach thought it necessary to his constructions in the Axiomatization first to establish empiricist criteria of genidentity the construction would not have begun Further Reading Ryckman gives a more general overview of Reichenbach s philosophy of physics Wilholt pp provides a useful description of Reichenbach s conventionalism and Giovanelli discusses in detail Reichenbach s early views on the geometrization of physics by general relativity which were at some point supposed to form part of the untranslated appendix to The Philosophy of Space and Time Einstein s brief review of the book can be found in Einstein Weinert discusses Reichenbach s causal theory of time and argues that it is an enthropic theory since the marks should be understood as irreversible processes The collection by Lutz Tuboly contains several articles that provide context for Reichenbach s philosophy of physics Reichenbach s discussion of quantum mechanics contains a then standard presentation of the formalism of the theory including the Born rule and without stating it the Projection Postulate see the entry on quantum mechanics It is marked however by Reichenbach s empiricism about meaning by his frequency interpretation of probability by a three valued quantum logic and by a curious neglect of the major problems and of some the most important previous foundational literature For later philosophical readers the missing piece in Reichenbach s discussion of the theory is the measurement problem see the section on the measurement problem in the entry on philosophical issues in quantum theory he gives no account of how the dynamical equation of the theory can account for uncorrelated measurement and object systems becoming correlated in a measurement interaction There was a considerable history of quantum logics before Reichenbach s work see the entry on quantum logic Martin Strauss had published a theory similar in spirit but not in detail to Kochen and Speckers partial Boolean algebras which appeared only thirty years later see the entry on the Kochen Specker theorem characterized by the fact that propositional connectives were allowed only among simultaneously verifiable propositions Reichenbach objects that some quantum mechanical propositions whose logical form contains no propositional operators may be unverifiable Paulette Fevrier had also introduced a three valued logic to which Reichenbach makes a similar objection Strikingly absent is any reference to Birkhoff and von Neumann s paper on the logical structure of quantum mechanics which introduces a logical structure for orthocomplemented lattices and projective geometries We can scarcely believe Reichenbach did not know of it and the neglect is difficult to explain Reichenbach seems to know of everything else and he was in correspondence with Bargmann at the Institute for Advanced Study Reichenbach cites von Neumann s Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics but only with regard to von Neumann s no hidden variable theorem see the entry on quantum logic and the section on the measurement problem in the entry on philosophical issues in quantum theory Reichenbach s quantum logic has three values True Indeterminate and False Indeterminate is the value of propositions that quantum theory implies cannot be assessed to be either true or false Three unary propositional functions are defined one corresponding to classical negation as well as seven binary functions including classical disjunction conjunction and equivalence Reichenbach gives no axiomatization and no rules of inference although passages suggest he intended an analog of modus ponens to hold for his two new conditional functions and of course he therefore provides neither soundness nor completeness theorems Nor does he characterize the class of functions that may be defined by composition of his propositional functions He does derive various properties of the new connectives from their definitions Reichenbach was quite explicit that logic is not empirical The rules of logic cannot be affected by physical experience p His logic with Indeterminate as a value of propositions is the same as logic with not empirically meaningful as a value In Reichenbach s view that is the logic as it were with or without quantum mechanics It is only that before quantum mechanics the principle of equivalent descriptions precluded any need to pay attention to the Indeterminate value As early as Reichenbach had essayed a probabilistic account of the direction of time d and in he still endorsed it rejecting on familiar reversibility grounds proposals to rely on entropy increase i vol I p His final work almost completed at his death was on the direction of time Reichenbach did not doubt that we have a definite psychological separation of time into past and future corresponding respectively to events that can and cannot be remembered His concern in The Direction of Time is for a physical basis for the same asymmetry The issues of a specific physical explanation of the psychological asymmetry and of how there can be a changing psychological present a moving now were to have been addressed in an unwritten final chapter Reichenbach offers three accounts of the direction of time The first is that the direction of time in a region of space time is the most common direction of increasing entropy among multiple nearly isolated systems in that region The idea as Reichenbach notes is Boltzmann s The second answer is that the direction of time is that in which causal events turn high entropy systems into low entropy ordered systems In the reverse direction of the same process he says from low entropy to high entropy the sequence of events is not causal but purposive Thus stepping in sand makes a shape low entropy from a flat surface high entropy The reverse process removing the foot from the sand followed by the foot impression filling with sand is not causal but purposive We do not pretend to understand this argument The third argument intends to produce a direction of time from causal directions inferred from macrostatistics This is the perhaps the aspect of the book most often discussed and it both breaks new ground and occasionally stumbles in the furrows Reichenbach argues that spatially and temporally close coincidences of two causal processes suffice to determine that the coincidence is either a common cause or a common effect of two other events He postpones the issue of how it can be known that there is any causal connection between remote events He claims correctly that this implies that a causally connected network an acyclic directed graph of events can have only two orientations reversing any edge requires reversing all other edges to yield an equivalent directed graph In an anticipation of st century discussions Woodward he considers whether interventions can disambiguate cause from effect in such a network and argues that they cannot on counterfactual considerations that are not entirely clear to us Reichenbach s discussion of the relations of probability and causality began in his doctoral thesis and continued in his paper Reichenbach d which until The Direction of Time he often cited himself with approval In The Direction of Time Reichenbach acknowledges that the claims were incorrect and formulates a new Principle of the Common Cause this way If an improbable coincidence has occurred there must exist a common cause p For any instance he says the conclusion of the principle is not certain but only probable the more probable the more frequent the coincidences He formulates four conditions he says are satisfied when an association of simultaneous occurrences of A and B is due to a common cause C simultaneous with neither A nor B C is not independent of A or of B but A and B are independent conditional on C and also independent conditional on C He says the principle is sometimes used in a weaker sense requiring only that the probability of A and of B be raised by the occurrence of C but he says that the independence can usually be established by the use of a more detailed description of the cause C p n Reichenbach does not say that his conditions are sufficient for C to be a common cause of A and B and as Artzenius has noted they are not Artzenius and the entry Reichenbach s common cause principle Using the principle Reichenbach considers how to distinguish the conjunctive fork open to the future and the conjunctive fork open to the past structures I and II respectively below Considering only binary variables Reichenbach says in structure I the common cause case A and B are not individually independent of C the probability of each is greater conditional on C than conditional on C but A and B are independent of one another conditional on C and on C He recognizes what has come to be called the collider phenomenon in contrast to structure I in a conjunctive fork open to the past structure II A and B are independent but dependent conditional on C their joint effect p In modern terminology this structure is an unshielded collider Reichenbach senses the tension between the collider phenomenon in conjunctive forks open to the past and his Principle of the Common Cause which posits that other than in exceptional cases a dependency between events or variables is due to a common cause In a conjunctive fork open to the past there is an association albeit conditional that is not explained by a common cause Reichenbach does not regard two or more variables with a common effect as unusual or an exceptional case Instead he claims that a conjunctive fork open to the past cannot occur it is logically possible but not scientifically possible Whenever two or more variables A and B cause a third he claims there must also be a common cause of A and B structure III Colliders in current terminology are possible in nature but conjunctive forks open to the past are not His argument is that to allow otherwise would be to allow unscientific fatalism which is inconsistent with thermodynamics p The direction of time is given by conjunctive forks open to the future In this passage Reichenbach is close to a profound statistical insight but ultimately muddles the explanation Using an example with the structure III he writes For instance the spouting of the geysers may have the effect that two clouds are formed which merge into one large cloud Then the occurrence of this large cloud is an effect E which satisfies the probability properties of structure I p This is an important mistake In structure III representing the causal structure of the geyser cloud example A and B are independent conditional on D but for almost all probability distributions A and B are not independent conditional on C and D That is III implies for almost all probability distributions that none of A B C D are pairwise independent that A B are independent conditional on D and that A B are not independent conditional on C or on C and D If the directions of edges in III are reversed as in IV the same relations hold but with C and D interchanged The direction of the causal relations between the eruption and the formation of the large cloud is thus encoded in the conditional probability relations Yet Reichenbach mangles the relationships in a confused passage Thus Reichenbach seems to think that in II above A and B are independent conditional on C but in III A and B are dependent conditional on C and the absence of D Reichenbach s confusions on these points is understandable well into the s much the same could be heard from several statisticians In order to see the correct relations Reichenbach would have had to have explicitly formulated the factorization of the joint distribution for binary variables that is implicit in his other discussions and computed the joint distribution of independent causes conditional on values of a common effect He did not Alternatively with linear systems it is trivial to calculate the partial correlations of the causes controlling for the effect but Reichenbach undoubtedly did not know the formulas Hartry Field argues that Reichenbach s adherence to the Principle of the Common Cause blocked a better macroscopic causal account of the direction of time that would allow conjunctive forks open to the past and use principles connecting causal direction with conditional probabilities such as those in the PC algorithm Spirtes et al Reichenbach continues with an illustration of screening off and a definition of causally between for events The illustration is a causal chain A B C A and C are independent conditional on the occurrence of B He does not say that screening off requires that A and C are also independent conditional on B but his statement of the Principle of the Common Cause strongly suggests as much He defines causally between as follows Definition An event A is causally between the events A and A if the relations hold p Recall that the dot is conjunction and P A A in Reichenbach s notation is P A A P A A P A in the currently conventional notation Reichenbach goes on to claim that a common effect of two causes is causally between its two causes thus A A A which is obviously false if absence of any causal connection implies independence Throughout his life Reichenbach implicitly makes this assumption in his examples about causal relations With such an assumption it follows that P A A P A P A P A A P A P A P A P A contradicting in the definition One may take these and other examples as evidence that Reichenbach did not have in mind instances of what is now called the causal Markov condition that conditional on its relatively direct causes a variable is independent of variables that are not its effects or alternatively that he was simply confused about the properties of colliders common effects in causal graphs We prefer the latter interpretation Causal direction in a network is now determined by supposing an asymmetrical intervention is available which Reichenbach calls a mark Marks are assumed to be passed down causal chains and to imply an increase in the probability of each downstream event Using the time order so obtained causal relevance is defined as Definition An event A is causally relevant to a later event A if P A A P A and there exists no set of events A A n which are earlier than or simultaneous with A such that this set screens off A from A p Definition provides a clear anticipation of a proposal made years later by Patrick Suppes Suppes The Direction of Time ends with a discussion of quantum statistical mechanics focused on issues of the identity of particles through time Reichenbach entertained non standard logics as early as in the form of probability logic In the Theory of Probability probability logic amounts to no more than the assignment of probability values to formulas in the propositional calculus Later a three valued logic was introduced for quantum theory as discussed above Reichenbach s major effort in logic however is in Elements of Symbolic Logic published in but begun as lecture notes for courses during Reichenbach s Turkish years The book is notable chiefly for the extended and detailed effort to formalize universal logical structures of conversational languages within the limits of first order logic and type theory Reichenbach s knowledge of German English French and especially Turkish helped to make his proposals linguistically serious and the result a detailed and in some respects quite original logical grammar including accounts of adverbial modification tense and modality is substantially richer than related logical efforts of his contemporaries Other topics of interest such as vagueness are not discussed Reichenbach perhaps considered vagueness a mistake rather than a topic for logical analysis In Reichenbach circulated an unpublished manuscript e vol p touching on Hilbert s program and G del s theorems Reichenbach was not persuaded that G del s proof of the impossibility of proving consistency within a sufficiently strong formalized language was of any philosophical significance a more profound analysis shows Hilbert s program to be unshaken and independent of G del s results To prove the latter statement first let us inquire into the significance of the theorem stating that the proof of consistency is only to be given in the metalanguage What then would happen if the metalanguage should turn out to be inconsistent This would lead to the consequence not that our deduction of the statement of consistency is incorrect but that the contrary of this statement could also be deduced and this indeed would make our statement valueless Now let us assume for a moment that G del s second theorem did not hold or with other words that G del had proved the contrary of his theorem This would mean that the proof of consistency of the language L could be given within L A simple analysis shows that this would not improve the situation since in this case our proof of consistency of L would be of value only if we were sure that L is consistent In case L were not consistent we could also deduce the statement of the consistency of L with the qualification that then the negation of the statement were deducible too Thus if the consistency of L were deduced within L this fact would not prove the consistency of L p Hilbert s meta proof of consistency by contrast Reichenbach thinks is genuinely important The consistency of any interpreted formalism can be judged empirically if there is empirical evidence for the claims made within the formalism and Reichenbach argues that the proposition within the formalism that asserts that the interpreted formal system is consistent has an empirical probability the only kind Reichenbach allows of course at least as high as that of any other claim in the language But for mathematics the language must be separated into the part concerned with rational numbers which can be interpreted so that measurements give rational numbers as values and the part concerned with real or complex numbers which correspond to no empirical measurement Since all theorems of applied mathematics are deducible from the subsystem of physical interpretation of the field of rational numbers it is only this subsystem which is verified by the interpretations vol I p So we cannot empirically confirm any claims that are properly about real or complex numbers so we cannot empirically confirm their consistency Hence we need Hilbert s program of metamathematics which by arithmetizing the claims of mathematical languages reduces claims of their consistency to claims in finite mathematics about the manipulations of symbols a claim that can be confirmed empirically see the entry on Hilbert s program We leave to the reader to diagnose how this separatist account fits with Reichenbach s insistence that Bayes theorem suffices to estimate an empirical probability for theoretical claims that are not directly empirically confirmable In The Theory of Probability modal necessity is identified with universal quantification and possibility is identified with joint existential quantification of a propositional matrix and existential quantification of its denial At least the spirit of this account is retained in Reichenbach s later discussions of modality His account of modality in Elements of Symbolic Logic c was developed as a separate work in Nomological Statements and Admissible Operations e and is the basis for his discussion of possibility and necessity in his essay on freedom of the will Completed before his death and published soon after Nomological Statements and Admissible Operations was reissued in under the title Laws Modalities and Counterfactuals with an invaluable expository foreword by Wesley Salmon Reichenbach s own presentation is a nearly impenetrable mix of conditions on truth entailment logical form and verifiability which surely contributed to its lack of influence Little if any discussion of it is to be found in the decades of literature on conditionals and counterfactuals since its publication In contrast to Carnap who was at work on modality at about the same time Reichenbach understands the task of his theory to be to explain the logical form and content of subjunctives especially of contrary to fact conditionals and at the same time to explain how empirical evidence can warrant some counterfactuals warrant the denial of others and leave still others undecided He therefore regards the ability of the theory to account for our common sense judgments of the truth or falsity of sentences involving subjunctives counterfactuals laws and modals as critical to its evaluation Reichenbach s theory is founded on an account of natural laws He views the logical form of all declarative sentences modal counterfactual or otherwise as specifiable in an extensional first order or typed language Modality is a property of sentences not part of their content and modal sentences therefore involve both a declarative sentence and a meta language claim about that sentence As in Carnap s account all modality is de dicto Reichenbach is initially concerned with distinguishing conditionals that as indicative sentences are true because of the falsity of their antecedents from true or at least assertable subjunctive conditionals that have false antecedents or antecedents not known to be true The former contain uses of propositional connectives or operations in Reichenbach s terminology that are inadmissible Reichenbach s strategy is to characterize admissible operations that is assertable subjunctive conditionals and their truth values by their deductive relations with indicative nomological statements Fundamental or original nomological statements are those logically equivalent to a true sentence with no terms that essentially refer to particulars in prenex form with at least one universal quantifier and such that no logically stronger sentence in the same vocabulary is true Derivative nomological statements are logical consequences of original nomological statements but not all derivative nomological statements are admissible To avoid conditionals true because of false antecedents or sentences true because of irrelevant disjuncts Reichenbach essentially requires that derivative nomological statements be the logically strongest sentences in their vocabulary that are consequences of original nomological statements Statements are graded Original nomological statements have grade derivative nomological statements grade and other statements grade A counterfactual conditional can only be true or assertible if its antecedent has a grade at least as high as its consequent Rather elaborate further conditions on logical form are imposed to avoid counterexamples Counterfactuals about particulars are understood to be true if the corresponding indicative conditionals are instances of true nomological generalizations Modal claims of necessity are construed as indicatives combined with a meta claim that the indicative is nomological Possibility claims have corresponding meta claims asserting that the denial of the indicative is not nomological Almost as an afterthought Reichenbach notes that quantification must be over possible as well as actual objects but he provides no logical mechanism for specifying such de re modalities Reichenbach s discussion of free action and free will is an attempt to reconcile our judgments that some actions are done freely and others are not with a scientific and materialist conception of the world An action is free if there is a prior circumstance in which a volition of the actor causes the action and in that otherwise the same circumstance a volition to act otherwise would with high probability have brought about a different action Reichenbach goes to some lengths to explain just how the volition must cause the action in order to be free but the conditions are open to fairly simple counter examples He also makes no attempt to relate free action to moral responsibility or its absence to innocence The Rise of Scientific Philosophy a Reichenbach s last and most successful popular book presents his broad philosophical viewpoint in an accessible way The English prose is more fluent than in earlier works and occasionally almost as pithy as Russell s Four chapters of the book provide Reichenbach s review of the history of philosophical pretensions to a priori knowledge in metaphysics epistemology and ethics Writing of Kant Reichenbach instructs His cognitive a priori coincides with the physics of his time his moral a priori with the ethics of his social class Let this coincidence be a warning to all those who claim to have found the ultimate truth p Of Hamlet Reichenbach writes To be or not to be that is not a question but a tautology p Much of the remainder of the book consists of selective popular science summaries amid simplified restatements of the views in The Philosophy of Space and Time h and Experience and Prediction c The news in the book is the extended discussion of ethics In his contribution to the Schilpp volume a on John Dewey Reichenbach had written at some length and with considerable disdain about Dewey s ethical theory His personal relations with Dewey are unknown to us but it is possible that Reichenbach knew and disapproved of Dewey s enthusiasm for World War I About ethics Reichenbach was at least as pragmatic as Dewey but about metaethics and in particular about the logical form of ethical sentences he was in close accord with Charles Leslie Stevenson s imperativism To assert X is good is just to assert I approve of X Do so as well In The Rise of Scientific Philosophy he insists that ethical statements express volitional decisions without truth values that are not subject to empirical knowledge The empirical issues of ethics are only the causal questions of relations of means to ends Reichenbach allows a place for logic in reasoning from ethical premises to ethical conclusions but he insists that the characteristic feature of ethical statements and the proper conclusion of ethical reasoning is a call to action Whatever else they are ethical claims are imperatives His recommendation for resolving fundamental ethical disagreements is not philosophy or science but social friction In keeping with his politics Reichenbach s last practical advice was the same as Joe Hill s Organize But Reichenbach s deepest ethical injunction was implicit in his most popular book to form beliefs to judge them to change them to weigh actions to distinguish real from merely verbal differences by the canons of scientific philosophy Further Reading In a somewhat unusual description of Reichenbach s work McCumber characterizes The Rise of Scientific Philosophy as Cold War philosophy that prudently avoids the traps of its time No complete list of Reichenbach s doctoral students appears to be available In Turkey there was no graduate program in philosophy but his student Nusret Hizir continued to develop Reichenbach s ideas in Turkey After coming to UCLA in Reichenbach had at least six Ph D students known to us W Bruce Taylor studied with him between and but we do not know about his subsequent career he listed no academic affiliation in Melvin Maron and Norman Martin are listed by the Mathematics Genealogy Project as completing their Ph D s with Reichenbach in and respectively Martin was an expert in computer design and architecture and became professor at the University of Texas where he taught until in three departments Philosophy Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering We have no further record of Maron Cynthia Shuster became a professor at Washington State University from where she was fired during the McCarthy era for corrupting the youth by inviting Robert Oppenheimer to speak on campus She continued her career at the University of Montana until her death Hilary Putnam who was at Princeton and then Harvard until his retirement besides other important contributions less directly connected to Reichenbach combined Reichenbach s emphasis on learning in the limit with the theory of computation to create the foundations of computational learning theory which remains a major theme in theoretical computer science Ruth Anna Putnam Professor of Philosophy at Wellesley College and Hilary Putnam s wife was not Reichenbach s doctoral student but was profoundly influenced by his undergraduate courses She typed up his notes for The Direction of Time and later completed her Ph D under the supervision of Rudolf Carnap Maynes Gimbel Lerner Until his death Wesley Salmon who taught at Washington State UCLA Northwestern Brown Arizona and Pittsburgh was the philosopher who most prominently and loyally developed and defended Reichenbach s views especially but not exclusively his views on probability and on the justification of induction Carl Hempel took his doctorate in Berlin with Reichenbach After moving to the United States he taught at Yale Princeton and then Pittsburgh Hempel s work on confirmation was discussed by Reichenbach but had no connection to his own Early in his career Hempel s thought was more closely connected with Carnap s logical approaches while his later views were more closely allied with those of Thomas Kuhn and in general his intellectual and personal relations with Reichenbach do not appear to have been close Some of Reichenbach s ideas have reemerged in recent philosophy without notice of the connection Michael Strevens Bigger Than Chaos Strevens reprises the views and arguments of Reichenbach s doctoral thesis without the Kantian gloss Gil Harman and Sanjeev Kulkarni s Reliable Reasoning adopts a view of induction very close to Reichenbach s Reichenbach s views on underdetermination in physics were developed extensively by Adolf Grunbaum but as a metaphysical rather than epistemological thesis The issue of the conventionality of simultaneity relations has attracted a large philosophical literature Reichenbach s Principle of the Common Cause has attracted extensive philosophical comment much of it devoted to purported counterexamples to a strict universal claim that Reichenbach explicitly denied Without reference to Reichenbach the principle was restated in the s by Herbert Simon as a claim about the explanation of spurious correlations Under the name Markov condition in the early s Reichenbach s principle was generalized by several statisticians most notably Terry Speed Kiiveri Speed and today plays an essential role in representation and search for causal relations We do not know whether Simon who had been Carnap s student at the University of Chicago knew of Reichenbach s ideas the statisticians very likely did not Perhaps not coincidentally the senior author of this entry who helped to develop the directed graphical representation into search and prediction procedures for causal hypotheses studied with two of Reichenbach s doctoral students Schuster and Salmon As noted above Reichenbach anticipated formulations of probabilistic causal relevance advanced by Patrick Suppes in A Probabilistic Theory of Causality and the use of marks can be found in a somewhat different guise in Salmon and Dowe s work on causality With the exception of discussions of the conventionality of simultaneity Reichenbach s Axiomatization seems to have had little influence on subsequent work whereas Robb s rediscovered in the s has attracted some development from both philosophers and physicists The interventionist account of causation in the Axiomatization and more clearly in The Philosophy of Space and Time has been developed in various ways by several st century writers without explicit debt to Reichenbach Michael Friedman has attempted to revive the quasi Kantian viewpoint of Reichenbach s The Theory of Relativity and A Priori Knowledge emphasizing the relativized a priori A considerable literature in linguistics has pursued Reichenbach s ideas about the logical form and semantics of conversational language especially about tense and the logical form of adverbial modification see Binnick in the Other Internet Resources section below for a bibliography Kamp lays out in some detail the enormous influence in linguistics of Reichenbach s short comments in Elements of Symbolic Logic pp that recognized the distinction between speech time reference time and event time in the logical analysis of tense Thus in the past perfect had slept the event time precedes reference time which precedes speech time while in the simple past slept the event time coincides with reference time while both precede speech time see also Malatesta Though Reichenbach never provided a precise definition of reference time the subsequent analysis of reference time and its relation to event time led to the development of formal semantics that could handle a rich representation of context e g Kamp s own Discourse Representation Theory In an ambitious book length study of Reichenbach s theory McMahon takes Reichenbach s proposal to be a progenitor of Chomsky s theory of syntax and attempts to supplement Reichenbach s account with appropriate re write rules Reichenbach s own discussion contains no explicit generative grammar or computational models More recently Seiler Weber suggested that Reichenbach s reference time is not always as sharply defined as his writings suggest and propose a modified account that permits an underspecified reference time Hilary Putnam has praised Reichenbach s work as one of the most magnificent attempts by any empiricist philosopher of this or of any other century and called for more historical study of his work We do not disagree but a candid philosophical retrospective assessment of any major philosopher is bound to find flaws As Putnam emphasizes in the end Reichenbach tried to found epistemology and metaphysics on probability relations but he evaded or dismissed coherent and pointed challenges from Ernest Nagel and others as to how his conception of probability could serve the purposes he required of it Reichenbach s work repeatedly ignored or discounted the contemporaneous or prior efforts of others that address the issues that concerned him efforts that are in one or another way as good as or importantly better than his own That is true with respect to Robb with regard to the causal construction of space time relations it is true with respect to Kolmogorov with regard to the theory of probability it is true with respect to Birkhoff and von Neumann with regard to quantum logic The effect has been to make much of Reichenbach s best known work something of a scientific and philosophical eddy rather than a main current Reichenbach nonetheless was a central figure in forming the mainstream of th century philosophy of science as a crossdisciplinary study devoted to reconstructing and justifying received science rather than to proposing novel scientific frameworks or novel methodologies At least in that fundamental respect he remained a Kantian throughout his

With the annual United Nations climate change conference commencing in Belem Brazil on Thursday the global community is once again reminded of the urgency of meaningful and concerted efforts to counter climate change But as delegates from around the world convene for COP to seek consensus on climate change solutions some media outlets in the United States have been speculating that through its decision earlier this year to withdraw from the landmark Paris Agreement the US may have handed China a huge victory at the conference in Belem Their intent is to undermine Beijing s efforts to rally countries to the cause The US announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement for the second time on Jan following an executive order issued by US President Donald Trump on his first day in office at the commencement of his second presidency A White House spokeswoman confirmed recently that the US will not send any highlevel representatives to COP In the absence of US leadership the US media concluded China might take a more leading and direct role in the climate change negotiations I was shocked by such a viewpoint and the mindset behind it First of all let us be clear no country can win in the collective fight against global warming if such a competitive mindset lingers in fact there will be no winners at all if we fail to adhere to climate multilateralism This is a lesson my year old son learned recently An avid player of a popular shooter game he had always approached the game with a single minded focus eliminate as many opponents as possible For him victory was measured by the number of enemies he could take down But during his last visit to the gaming arena something changed The company that runs the game has introduced a new capture the flag challenge whereby the objective has shifted from the number of kills to the shared goal of seizing or defending the flag My son and many of his peers have struggled to adapt They have clung to their old mindset prioritizing the number of kills over the collective goals The result They have lost every game The parallels to the climate crisis are striking For too long some nations have approached climate action with a competitive mindset as shown by the divisive speculation of the US media Such a mindset puts at risk not just its holders future but also that of all Climate change knows no borders and its impacts whether rising sea levels scorching heat waves devastating hurricanes or crippling droughts will spare no nation The truth is there is no victory in a world where polar ice caps are melting ecosystems are collapsing and entire communities are being displaced The only path forward is one of collaboration where nations set aside their differences and work toward a common goal The capture the flag analogy offers a valuable lesson In that game success depends on how well you work together to achieve a shared objective The same is true for climate action We must move beyond the outdated mindset of competition and embrace cooperation This means investing in renewable energy sharing technologies and supporting vulnerable nations in their climate struggles As COP kicks off the world must recognize that climate change is not a game There are no winners or losers only collective success or collective failure My son is still young He needs time to learn about the ways of the world But the journalists who wrote those speculative reports and the experts who joined the discussions are not youngsters anymore They should stop acting like children

The first batch of Hangor class submarines under a China Pakistan cooperation project is expected to enter operational service with the Pakistan Navy in Admiral Naveed Ashraf chief of the Naval Staff of the Pakistan Navy told the Global Times in a recent exclusive interview He said that the Hangor class submarine program is progressing smoothly and that the successful launch of the second and third submarines in China earlier this year is a major milestone for naval collaboration between China and Pakistan Pakistan signed a contract with China to procure eight Hangor class conventional submarines in with the first four to be constructed by China and the rest to be assembled by Pakistan so as to improve Pakistan s technical capabilities according to open reports According to the plan Pakistan will acquire eight advanced submarines between and The first Hangor class conventionally powered submarine was launched in China in April while the second and third vessels were consecutively launched this year Ashraf spoke highly of this China Pakistan cooperation project He said that the project is not only significant for advancement of the Pakistan Navy s submarine force capabilities but will also contribute toward self reliance through transfer of technology and skill development at Karachi Shipyard Engineering Works It reflects professionalism and close naval equipment collaboration between China and Pakistan Besides the submarine project the Type A P frigates mark another major achievement in China Pakistan naval equipment cooperation This type of multirole frigates is already in service with the Pakistan Navy with Ashraf saying that they are among the most advanced surface combatants He told the Global Times that these Chinese made frigates have greatly strengthened the Pakistan Navy s multi mission capability particularly in air defense anti submarine warfare and maritime surveillance These platforms are playing a key role in ensuring maritime security in the North Arabian Sea and the broader Indian Ocean region which is critical for global economy he said noting that by securing vital sea lines of communication including those linked to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC the Pakistan Navy is playing a significant role in sustaining trade investment and economic activity that benefit not only Pakistan but the entire region Talking about the performance of Chinese made equipment Ashraf said that Chinese origin platforms and equipment have been reliable technologically advanced and well suited to Pakistan Navy s operational requirements He said that the Pakistan Navy s experience with them has been very positive both in terms of performance and technical support As modern warfare evolves emerging technologies such as unmanned systems AI and advanced electronic warfare systems are becoming increasingly important The Pakistan Navy is focusing on these technologies and exploring collaboration with China that has the leading industries in emerging technologies Ashraf said In recent years the navies of China and Pakistan have maintained frequent exchanges and cooperation The two sides have conducted multiple joint exercises and training activities in China and Pakistan as well as at high seas The content covers subjects such as joint counter terrorism anti piracy maritime replenishment formation maneuvering communication liaison and joint search and rescue In particular the Sea Guardians series of exercises has become an important brand for joint naval exercises between the two countries Ashraf told the Global Times that the Sea Guardians series of exercises represents the growing depth and maturity of Pakistan China naval cooperation He said that these exercises enhance interoperability tactical coordination and professional exchanges between the two navies and help us learn from each other s experiences in diverse warfare domains including counter terrorism antipiracy and maritime security operations Most importantly such engagements demonstrate our shared resolve to promote peace stability and freedom of navigation in the region he said On the topic of China Pakistan naval cooperation in the future Ashraf said that the Pakistan Navy s partnership with China is built on deep rooted friendship mutual respect trust and shared strategic interests In the coming decade we expect this relationship to grow stronger encompassing not only shipbuilding and training but also enhanced interoperability research technology sharing and industrial collaboration he said There is immense potential for cooperation in advanced technologies unmanned systems marine scientific research and maritime industry development Together we aim to ensure a secure and stable maritime environment that supports regional peace and prosperity said the Pakistani admiral China has been a trusted partner in the Pakistan Navy s modernization journey Ashraf said He noted that the introduction of advanced frigates and submarines has significantly enhanced the Pakistan Navy s operational reach multi domain war fighting capabilities and deterrence posture These modern platforms coupled with joint training and exercises with the PLA Navy have deepened the two sides professional synergy and strengthened interoperability at sea Ashraf said noting that this cooperation goes beyond hardware it reflects a shared strategic outlook mutual trust and a long standing partnership From Monday to Thursday the Pakistan Navy is organizing a second edition of Pakistan International Maritime Expo and Conference PIMEC in Karachi Pakistan The event is being organized with the aim to jump start the development of Pakistan s maritime sector and establish a platform to spur the blue economy and provide a platform to government to government and business business engagements according to the Pakistan Navy Ashraf said that PIMEC is a platform which showcases and leverages the country s strategic maritime assets including Gwadar port and the opportunities presented by the CPEC promoting investment in critical infrastructure to support trade and economic growth He noted that with PIMEC the Pakistan Navy aims to promote blue economy and technological advancements as well as address emerging maritime threats through international cooperation

Notice While JavaScript is not essential for this website your interaction with the content will be limited Please turn JavaScript on for the full experience Written by Faisal Dosani and Akshay Gupta Capital One Dependency management in any language can be a challenge and Python is no exception Tools like pip and conda use dependency resolvers to try and honor the requirements given to them but oftentimes version conflicts prevent installation this problem became more apparent when pip introduced a new resolver in October New versions of an upstream package can break your code and tracking down the culprit can be even more challenging if you have a long list of transient dependencies edgetest is an open source plugin based Python package designed to help developers test their code against new versions of their existing dependencies edgetest helps alleviate some of the burden of dependency management by creating a virtual environment installing your local package into the environment upgrading specified dependency package s and running your test command e g pytest Maintenance cost and environment management has become a part of running the engine with the pip resolver Now edgetest can help reduce the maintenance cost of packages by automating bleeding edge dependency testing For example if you depend on pandas edgetest will test your project against the most current pandas version as of writing With an effective test suite you will know whether you can safely upgrade to pandas or not edgetest will report whether or not it is safe to upgrade based on the test results It will do this for each dependency individually before upgrading all upstream packages to identify any potential interactions Why We Built edgetest After pip introduced a dependency resolver in October we decided to take a more prescriptive approach to dependency pinning for internal projects at Capital One Specifically this involved adding both lower and upper pins to any direct dependencies for all packages However this decision added a new form of maintenance cost updating the pins We needed an automated way to help remediate security vulnerabilities identified in packages and continue to support the latest version of dependencies in a way that scaled edgetest was a solution to this problem given the number of Python packages our team supported during that time Machine learning packages can often have complex dependency structures and experimentation with new features is critical While implementations of models should always pin packages to ensure deterministic behavior and auditability we don t want the tools themselves to be unnecessarily restrictive but to allow for some flexibility in their implementation We can now have scheduled CI CD jobs which automatically run edgetest against many internal libraries to run unit tests and bump dependency pins ensuring some level of trust in the latest versions We should note that having robust unit testing is really critical to getting the most out of edgetest Is This Different from GitHub s Dependabot edgetest is not tied to a particular version control system like GitHub It also prevents accidental updates by only upgrading package dependencies when unit tests are passing Finally some users want to focus on a subset of their dependency tree for updates Sometimes these are dependencies that release often e g boto and sometimes these packages are core to their library s functionality edgetest offers multiple configuration options to help users create a test and upgrade a system that is functional for their use case edgetest in Action For example let s imagine a simple toy package like so To configure edgetest we can include the following within our setup cfg And run with the following command line statement edgetest c setup cfg This will tell edgetest to use Python and also to install the tests extra into each conda environment edgetest will create three environments pandas numpy and all requirements In the first two it will only upgrade the respective packages with those names and the all requirements will upgrade both pandas and numpy Next the test command pytest is the default is run in each environment and the results are reported back to the user Alternatively you can also provide the export flag to write the changes to setup cfg for you if you wish Using a Plugin Architecture One of the goals for edgetest was to ensure easy extensibility which led us to use pluggy Pluggy enables the extension or modification of the core package enabling the Python community to build custom plugins to interact with edgetest Currently there are three plugins conda pip tools and hub With pluggy we mapped out several hookspecs These hooks allow a user to override and inject their custom code to complement or override the base functionality The create environment hook for example enables using custom environment managers such as conda Below is a comparison of the hookimpl between the base functionality and plugin override What s Next One of the biggest benefits of edgetest is the ability to automate A GitHub Action built on edgetest is

Individual autonomy is an idea that is generally understood to refer to the capacity to be one s own person to live one s life according to reasons and motives that are taken as one s own and not the product of manipulative or distorting external forces to be in this way independent It is a central value in the Kantian tradition of moral philosophy but it is also given fundamental status in John Stuart Mill s version of utilitarian liberalism Kant Mill ch III Examination of the concept of autonomy also figures centrally in debates over education policy biomedical ethics various legal freedoms and rights such as freedom of speech and the right to privacy as well as moral and political theory more broadly In the realm of moral theory seeing autonomy as a central value can be contrasted with alternative frameworks such an ethic of care utilitarianism of some kinds and an ethic of virtue Autonomy has traditionally been thought to connote independence and hence to reflect assumptions of individualism in both moral thinking and designations of political status For this reason certain philosophical movements such as certain strains of feminism have resisted seeing autonomy as a value Jaggar chap for a downgrading of autonomy for different reasons see Conly However in recent decades theorists have increasingly tried to structure the concept so as to sever its ties to this brand of individualism In all such discussions the concept of autonomy is the focus of much controversy and debate disputes which focus attention on the fundamentals of moral and political philosophy and the Enlightenment conception of the person more generally In the western tradition the view that individual autonomy is a basic moral and political value is very much a modern development Putting moral weight on an individual s ability to govern herself independent of her place in a metaphysical order or her role in social structures and political institutions is very much the product of the modernist humanism of which much contemporary moral and political philosophy is an offshoot For historical discussions of autonomy see Schneewind Swain and Rosich As such it bears the weight of the controversies that this legacy has attracted The idea that moral principles and obligations as well as the legitimacy of political authority should be grounded in the self governing individual considered apart from various contingencies of place culture and social relations invites skeptics from several quarters Autonomy then is very much at the vortex of the complex re consideration of modernity Put most simply to be autonomous is to govern oneself to be directed by considerations desires conditions and characteristics that are not simply imposed externally upon one but are part of what can somehow be considered one s authentic self Autonomy in this sense seems an irrefutable value especially since its opposite being guided by forces external to the self and which one cannot authentically embrace seems to mark the height of oppression But specifying more precisely the conditions of autonomy inevitably sparks controversy and invites skepticism about the claim that autonomy is an unqualified value for all people Autonomy plays various roles in theoretical accounts of persons conceptions of moral obligation and responsibility the justification of social policies and in numerous aspects of political theory It forms the core of the Kantian conception of practical reason see e g Korsgaard Hill and relatedly connects to questions of moral responsibility see Wolff It is also seen as the aspect of persons that prevents or ought to prevent paternalistic interventions in their lives Dworkin Conly It plays a role in education theory and policy on some views specifying the core goal of liberal education generally Gutmann Cuypers and Haji for discussion see Brighouse It is central to many approaches to bioethics Pugh Also despite many feminists reservations concerning the ideal of autonomy it is sometimes seen as a valuable conceptual element in some feminist ideals such as the identification and elimination of social conditions that victimize women and other potentially vulnerable people Friedman Meyers Christman Veltman and Piper Roessler Several distinctions must be made to zero in on the kind of autonomy that is of greatest interest to moral and political theory Moral autonomy refers to the capacity to impose the putatively objective moral law on oneself and following Kant it is claimed as a fundamental organizing principle of all morality Hill On the other hand what can be called personal autonomy is meant as a trait that individuals can exhibit relative to any aspects of their lives not limited to questions of moral obligation Dworkin Swaine Personal or individual autonomy should also be distinguished from freedom although again there are many renderings of these concepts and certainly some conceptions of positive freedom will be equivalent to what is often meant by autonomy Berlin Roessler ch Christman Generally one can distinguish autonomy from freedom in that the latter concerns the ability to act without external or internal constraints and also on some conceptions with sufficient resources and power to make one s desires effective Berlin Crocker MacCallum and the essays in Christman ed Autonomy concerns the independence and authenticity of the desires values emotions etc that move one to act in the first place Some distinguish autonomy from freedom by insisting that freedom concerns particular acts while autonomy is a more global notion referring to states of a person Dworkin But autonomy can be used to refer both to the global condition autonomous personhood and as a more local notion autonomous relative to a particular trait motive value or social condition Addicted smokers for example are autonomous persons in a general sense but for some helplessly unable to control their behavior regarding this one activity Christman cf Meyers In addition we must keep separate the idea of basic autonomy the minimal status of being responsible independent and able to speak for oneself from ideal autonomy an achievement that serves as a goal to which we might aspire and according to which a person is maximally authentic and free of manipulative self distorting influences Any plausible conceptualization of basic autonomy must among other things imply that most adults who are not suffering from debilitating pathologies or are under oppressive and constricting conditions count as autonomous Autonomy as an ideal on the other hand may well be enjoyed by very few if any individuals for it functions as a goal to be attained The reason to construe basic autonomy broadly enough to include most adults is that autonomy connects with other status designators which apply or it is claimed should apply in this sweeping manner Autonomy is connected for example to moral and legal responsibility on some views e g Ripstein autonomous agency is seen as necessary and for some sufficient for the condition of equal political standing moreover being autonomous stands as a barrier to unchecked paternalism both in the personal informal spheres and in legal arenas Feinberg Lacking autonomy as young children do is a condition which allows or invites sympathy care paternalism and possibly pity Therefore a guiding consideration in evaluating particular conceptions of autonomy though hardly a hard and fast test will be whether it connects properly to these ancillary judgments for discussion of formal conditions of a concept of autonomy see Dworkin The variety of contexts in which the concept of autonomy functions has suggested to many that there are simply a number of different conceptions and that the word simply refers to different elements in each of those contexts Arpaly Others have claimed that while there may be a single over arching concept of autonomy we should think in terms of separable dimensions of it rather than an all or nothing idea Mackenzie and Killmister Still others object to the idea that self government the actual control we our selves exert over what we value and do should serve as the best model for autonomy or its value Berofsky Swain ch Buss Feinberg has claimed that there are at least four different meanings of autonomy in moral and political philosophy the capacity to govern oneself the actual condition of self government a personal ideal and a set of rights expressive of one s sovereignty over oneself Feinberg One might argue that central to all of these uses is a conception of the person able to act reflect and choose on the basis of factors that are somehow her own authentic in some sense Nevertheless it is clear that formulating a theory of the concept will involve more than merely uncovering the obscure details of the idea s essence for autonomy like many concepts central to contentious moral or political debate is itself essentially contested So a theory of autonomy is simply a conceptual model aimed at capturing the general sense of self rule or self government ideas which obviously admit of their own vagaries and which can be used to support principles or policies the theory attempts to justify The idea of self rule contains two components the independence of one s deliberation and choice from manipulation by others and the capacity to rule oneself see Dworkin f and Arneson However the ability to rule oneself will lie at the core of the concept since a full account of that capability will surely entail the freedom from external manipulation characteristic of independence Indeed it could be claimed that independence per se has no fixed meaning or necessary connection with self government unless we know what kinds of independence is required for self rule cf however Raz Focusing then on the requirements of self rule it can be claimed that to govern oneself one must be in a position to act competently based on desires values conditions etc that are in some sense one s own This picks out the two families of conditions often proffered in conceptions of autonomy competency conditions and authenticity conditions Competency includes various capacities for rational thought self control and freedom from debilitating pathologies systematic self deception and so on Different accounts include different conditions see for example Berofsky R Young Haworth Meyers Dworkin Lehrer Authenticity conditions often include the capacity to reflect upon and endorse or identify with one s desires values and so on The most influential models of authenticity in this vein claim that autonomy requires second order identification with first order desires For Frankfurt for instance such second order desires must actually have the structure of a volition wanting that the first order desires issue in action that they comprise one s will Moreover such identification on his view must be wholehearted for the resulting action to count as free autonomous This overall approach to autonomy has been very influential and several writers have developed variations of it and defended it against objections The most prominent objections concern on the one hand the fatal ambiguities of the concept of identification and on the other the threat of an infinite regress of conditions The first problem surrounds the different ways that one can be said to identify with a desire each of which render the view conceptually suspect Either one identifies with an aspect of oneself in the sense of simply acknowledging it without judgment or one identifies with a desire in an aspirational approving sense of that term In the first case however identification would clearly not be a consistent mark of autonomy for one could easily identify as part of oneself any manner of addictive constricting or imposed aspects of one s make up But approving of a trait is also problematic as a requirement of autonomy for there are many perfectly authentic aspects of myself ones for which I can and should be held fully responsible for example which I do not fully approve of I m not perfect but does that mean that I am thereby not autonomous Cf Watson Berofsky This model stresses internal self reflection and procedural independence However the view includes no stipulations about the content of the desires values and so on in virtue of which one is considered autonomous specifically there is no requirement that one act from desires independently of others Were there to be such a requirement it would involve what is called substantive independence Some writers have insisted that the autonomous person must enjoy substantive independence as well as procedural independence meaning that they must be free of external constraint from others especially in the formulation of their desires and plans meaning that they must be free of external constraint from others especially in the formulation of their desires and plans e g Stoljar Benson Oshana The motivation for such a position is the idea a person under conditions of constraint in the formulation of her preferences should not be considered autonomous no matter how voluntary or autonomous was the choice that put her in that position cf Meyers This claim however threatens to rob the attribution of autonomy of any claim to value neutrality it may otherwise carry for if conceptually one is not autonomous when one freely rationally without manipulation chooses to enter conditions of choice that are severely limited by others command or authority then the concept is reserved to only those lifestyles and value pursuits that are seen as acceptable from a particular political or theoretical point of view I will return to these lines of thought in a moment In rejoinder it has been claimed that merely procedural neutrality could not capture the value autonomy has for people and moreover a weakly substantive view can be compatible with a political form of liberalism as long as the values inherent in the concept could be accepted by reasonable persons in an overlapping consensus see Freyenhagen One variation on the internal self reflection model focuses on the importance of the personal history of the agent as an element of her autonomy Christman Mele cf Fisher Ravizza cf also Raz On these views the question of whether a person is autonomous at a time depends on the processes by which she came to be the way she is It is not clear that such a focus will be able to avoid the problems raised about internal reflection models see Mele Mackenzie Stoljar b but such a move attempts to embrace a conception of the self of self government which is not only social but diachronically structured see e g Cuypers For those who are wary of the postulate of reflective self endorsement an alternative approach is to equate autonomy with simply a set of competences such as the capacity to choose deliberatively rationally and as Berofsky claims objectively see Berofsky Meyers This locates autonomy in the general capacity to respond to reasons and not for example in acts of internal self identification However even in these accounts the capacity to think critically and reflectively is necessary for autonomy as one of the competences in question even though the reflective thought required need not refer to external values or ideals Berofsky ch Further difficulties have been raised with the requirement of second order self appraisal for autonomy For it is unclear that such higher level judgments have any greater claim to authenticity than their first order cousins Clearly if a person is manipulated or oppressed and hence non autonomous it could well be that the reflective judgments she makes about herself are just as tainted by that oppression as are her ground level decisions Thalberg Friedman Meyers Noggle and often our second order reflective voices are merely rationalizations and acts of self deception rather than true and settled aspects of our character for general discussion see the essays in Veltman and Piper This has led to the charge that models of autonomy which demand second order endorsement merely introduce an infinite regress for second level judgments must be tested for their authenticity in the same way as first order desires are but if that is so then ever higher levels of endorsement would be called for Various responses to this problem have been made for the most part involving the addition of conditions concerning the manner in which such reflection must be made for example that it must be free of certain distorting factors itself it must reflect an adequate causal history and the like Christman Mele Other aspects of the inner reflection model should be noted As just mentioned this view of autonomy is often stated as requiring critical self reflection see e g Haworth This has been understood as involving a rational appraisal of one s desires testing them for internal consistency their relation to reliable beliefs and the like But an overly narrow concentration on rational assessment exposes such conceptions to charges of hyper intellectualism painting a picture of the autonomous person as a cold detached calculator see Meyers Connections to values desires and personal traits are often grounded in emotional and affective responses ones connected with care commitment and relations to others see Friedman MacKenzie Stoljar b Meyers de Calleja Mirja Perez For parallel reasons some theorists have noted that concentration on only desires as the focal point of autonomy is overly narrow as people can fail to exhibit self government relative to a wide range of personal characteristics such as values physical traits relations to others and so on see Double Autonomy is central in certain moral frameworks both as a model of the moral person the feature of the person by virtue of which she is morally obligated and as the aspect of persons which grounds others obligations to her or him For Kant the self imposition of universal moral law is the ground of both moral obligation generally and the respect others owe to us and we owe ourselves In short practical reason our ability to use reasons to choose our own actions presupposes that we understand ourselves as free Freedom means lacking barriers to our action that are in any way external to our will though it also requires that we utilize a law to guide our decisions a law that can come to us only by an act of our own will for further discussion see Hill for doubts about this reading see Kleingeld and Willaschek This self imposition of the moral law is autonomy And since this law must have no content provided by sense or desire or any other contingent aspect of our situation it must be universal Hence we have the first formulation of the Categorical Imperative that by virtue of our being autonomous we must act only on those maxims that we can consistently will as a universal law The story continues however for the claim is that this capacity to impose upon ourselves the moral law is the ultimate source of all moral value for to value anything instrumentally or intrinsically implies the ability to make value judgments generally the most fundamental of which is the determination of what is morally valuable Some theorists who are not self described Kantians have made this inference central to their views of autonomy Paul Benson for example has argued that being autonomous implies a measure of self worth in that we must be in a position to trust our decision making capacities to put ourselves in a position of responsibility Benson cf also Grovier Lehrer and Westlund But the Kantian position is that such self regard is not a contingent psychological fact about us but an unavoidable implication of the exercise of practical reason cf Taylor So we owe to ourselves moral respect in virtue of our autonomy But insofar as this capacity depends in no way on anything particular or contingent about ourselves we owe similar respect to all other persons in virtue of their capacity Hence via the second formulation of the Categorical Imperative we are obliged to act out of fundamental respect for other persons in virtue of their autonomy In this way autonomy serves as both a model of practical reason in the determination of moral obligation and as the feature of other persons deserving moral respect from us For further discussion see Immanual Kant and moral philosophy Recent discussions of Kantian autonomy have downplayed the transcendental nature of practical reason in this account see for example Herman and Hill For example Christine Korsgaard follows Kant in seeing our capacity for self reflection as both the object of respect and the seat of normativity generally On her view we are all guided by what she calls a practical identity a point of view which orients reflection on values and manifests an aspect of our self concept But unlike Kant Korsgaard argues that we have different practical identities that are the source of our normative commitments and not all of them are of fundamental moral worth But the most general of such identities that which makes us members of a kingdom of ends is our moral identity which yields universal duties and obligations independent of contingent factors Autonomy is the source of all obligations whether moral or non moral since it is the capacity to impose upon ourselves by virtue of our practical identities obligations to act Korsgaard Traditional critiques of autonomy based moral views and Kant s in particular have been mounted along various lines I mention two here as they connect with issues concerning autonomy in social and political theory The first concerns the way in which autonomy based moral theory grounds obligation in our cognitive abilities rather than in our emotions and affective connections see e g Williams Stocker The claim is that Kantian morality leaves too little room for the kinds of emotional reactions that are constitutive of moral response in many situations the obligations of parents for example concern not only what they do but the passions and care they bring forth in doing it To view obligation as arising from autonomy but understanding autonomy in a purely cognitive manner makes such an account vulnerable to this kind of charge The difficulty this criticism points to resides in the ambiguities of the self description that we might utilize in valuing our humanity our capacity to obligate ourselves For we can reflect upon our decision making capacities and value this positively and fundamentally but regard that self engaging the capacity in different ways The Kantian model of such a self is of a pure cognizer a reflective agent engaged in practical reason But also involved in decision making are our passions emotions desires felt commitments senses of attraction and aversion alienation and comfort These are both the objects of our judgement and partly constitutive of them to passionately embrace an option is different from cooly determining it to be best Judgment is involved with all such passions when decisions are made And it judgment need not be understood apart from them but as an ability to engage in those actions whose passionate and reasoned support we muster up So when the optimal decision for me is an impassioned one I must value my ability to engage in the right passions not merely in the ability to cold heartedly reflect and choose Putting the passions outside the scope of reasoned reflection as merely an ancillary quality of the action to consider how to do something not merely what we are doing is to make one kind of decision Putting passions inside that scope saying that what it is right to do now is to act with a certain affect or passion is another Determining which action maxim is the right one to will require judgment even if it is judgment about what kinds of passion are appropriate to be moved by When we generalize from our ability to make the latter sort of judgments we must value not only the ability to weigh options and universalize them but also the ability to engage the right affect emotion etc Therefore we value ourselves and others as passionate reasoners not merely reasoners per se For a general discussion of autonomy emotion and acting for reasons see Tappolet The implication of this observation is that in generalizing our judgments in the manner Korsgaard following Kant says we must we need not commit ourselves to valuing only the cognitive capacities of humanity but also its affective and hence relatively subjective elements A second question is this since the reflection that is involved in autonomy and which according to this view is the source of normativity need only be hypothetical reflection upon one s desires and mental capacities then the question arises under what conditions is this hypothetical reflection meant to take place If the capacity for reflection is the seat of obligation then we must ask if the conditions under which such hypothetical reflection takes place are idealized in any sense if they are assumed to be reasonable for example Are we considering merely the reflections the actual person would make were she to turn her attention to the question no matter how unreasonable such reflections might be If so why should we think this grounds obligations If we assume they are reasonable then under some conditions moral obligations are not imposed by the actual self but rather by an idealized more rational self This implies that morality is not literally self imposed if by self one means the actual set of judgments made by the agent in question Indeed a Platonist realist about moral value could claim that the objective values which according to the theory apply to all agents independent of choice are in fact self imposed in this idealized sense they would be imposed were the person to reflect on the matter acting as a perfectly reasonable agent This shows the complex and potentially problematic implications of this ambiguity This points to the question of whether autonomy can be the seat of moral obligation and respect if autonomy is conceived in a purely procedural manner If no substantive commitments or value orientations are included in the conceptual specification of autonomy then it is unclear how this capacity grounds any particular substantive value commitments On the other hand if autonomy includes a specification of particular values in its conditions that the autonomous person must value her own freedom for example then it turns out that moral obligation and respect attaches only to those already committed in this way and not more generally to all rational agents as such as traditionally advertised by the view This echoes of course Hegel s critique of Kant These difficulties point to ambiguities in autonomy based moral views ones which may well be clarified in further developments of those theories They also pick up on traditional problems with Kantian ethics though there are many other such difficulties not mentioned here Before leaving moral philosophy we should consider ethical views which focus on autonomy but which do not depend directly on a Kantian framework Autonomy can play a role in moral theory without that theory being fully Kantian in structure For example it is possible to argue that personal autonomy has intrinsic value independent of a fully worked out view of practical reason Following John Stuart Mill for example one can claim that autonomy is one of the elements of well being Mill ch III Viewing autonomy as an intrinsic value or as a constitutive element in personal well being in this way opens the door to a generally consequentialist moral framework while paying heed to the importance of self government to a fulfilling life for discussion see Sumner It may also be unclear why autonomy viewed here as the capacity to reflect on and endorse one s values character and commitments should have value independent of the results of exercising that capacity Why is one person s autonomy intrinsically valuable when she uses it to say harm herself or make rash or morally skewed choices More generally how can we take account of the systematic biases and distortions that plague typical human reasoning in valuing people s capacity to make decisions for themselves see e g Conly This question becomes more acute as we consider ways that autonomy can obtain in degrees for then it is unclear why personal autonomy should be seen as equally valuable in persons who display different levels of it or different levels of those abilities that are its conditions such as rationality For example Swaine argues that on most accounts personal autonomy is consistent with agents engaging in any number of morally heinous acts It therefore should be rejected in favor of what he calls ethical autonomy a notion that links personal autonomy to moral character Specifically ethical autonomy is individual self rule modulated by moral character as such it can be seen as unqualifiedly valuable in ways that standard value neutral accounts cannot He claims that such a notion need not be problematically perfectionist nor must it be seen as part of a comprehensive moral doctrine in Rawls s sense Yet it uniquely captures a sense of autonomy which is both morally respectable and valuable as a personal trait Swaine for a view that amounts to a critical response to Swaine see Roessler Indeed autonomy is often cited as the ground of treating all individuals equally from a moral point of view But if autonomy is not an all or nothing characteristic this commitment to moral equality becomes problematic Arneson It can be argued that insofar as the abilities required for autonomy such as rational reflectiveness competences in carrying out one s decisions and the like vary across individuals within or between species as well then it is difficult to maintain that all autonomous beings have equal moral status or that their interests deserve the same weight in considering decisions that affect them Further if autonomy is understood as self government being moved only in ways consistent with our deepest cares and values when we act it is unclear how that has particular moral value independent of either the results of such action advancing our well being for example or the value simply of acting intentionally For example Buss argues that the reasons we have to value self governing agency in some metaphysical sense are unconnected to the various glosses on personal autonomy that are generally offered and the value these conditions have for the agent She claims that we need to distinguish the metaphysical condition of being a self governing agent from various desirable phenomena that are too often identified with this condition Buss For example many see autonomy as involving critical self reflection on our motives and value that move us to action But Buss points out that in many cases such as acting spontaneously or on a whim non reflective actions better express and grow out of our deepest cares and commitments a mark of self government than do those we might submit to critical appraisal ibid The move that must be made here I think picks up on Korsgaard s gloss on Kantianism and the argument that our reflective capacities ultimately ground our obligations to others and in turn others obligations to regard us as moral equals Arneson argues however that people surely vary in this capacity as well the ability to reflectively consider options and choose sensibly from among them Recall what we said above concerning the ambiguities of Korsgaard s account concerning the degree to which the self reflection that grounds obligation is idealized at all If it is then it is not the everyday capacity to look within ourselves and make a choice that gives us moral status but the more rarified ability to do so rationally in some full sense But we surely vary in our ability to reach that ideal so why should our autonomy be regarded as equally worthy The answer may be that our normative commitments do not arise from our actual capacities to reflect and to choose though we must have such capacities to some minimal degree but rather from the way in which we must view ourselves as having these capacities We give special weight to our own present and past decisions so that we continue on with projects and plans we make because all other things being equal we made them they are ours at least when we do them after some reflective deliberation The pull that our own decisions have on our ongoing projects and actions can only be explained by the assumption that we confer status and value on decisions simply because we reflectively made them perhaps though in light of external objective considerations This is an all or nothing capacity and hence may be enough to ground our equal status even if perhaps in real life we exercise this capacity to varying degrees Much has been written about conceptions of well being that rehearse these worries see Sumner Griffin Such a view might be buttressed with the idea that the attribution of autonomous agency and the respect that purportedly goes with it is itself a normative stance not a mere observation of how a person actually thinks and acts for discussion of this position see Christman chap and Korsgaard Autonomy is the aspect of persons that undue paternalism offends against Paternalistic interventions can be both interpersonal the permissibility of which are governed by social and moral norms and a matter of policy mediated by formal or legal rules Such interventions are identified not by the kind of acts they involve but by the justification given for them so that paternalism involves interference with a person s actions or knowledge against that person s will for the purpose of advancing that person s good Respect for autonomy is meant to prohibit such interventions because they involve a judgment that the person is not able to decide for herself how best to pursue her own good Autonomy is the ability to so decide so for the autonomous subject of such interventions paternalism involves a lack of respect for autonomy See also Paternalism But as our discussion of the nature of autonomy indicated it is often unclear exactly what that characteristic involves Important in this context is whether autonomy can be manifested in degrees whether the abilities and capacities that constitute autonomy obtain all at once or progressively or I can enjoy sufficient autonomy in some areas of my life but not in others If autonomy is a matter of degree in any of these ways then it is unclear that a blanket prohibition against paternalism is warranted Some people will be less able to judge for themselves what their own good is and hence be more susceptible to justified paternalistic intervention Conly see also Killmister chap Often such an obligation toward another person requires us to treat her as autonomous independent of the extent to which she is so concerning the choice in question At least this is the case when a person is autonomous above a certain threshold she is an adult not under the influence of debilitating factors and so on I might know that a person is to some degree under the sway of external pressures that are severely limiting her ability to govern her life and make independent choices But as long as she has not lost the basic ability to reflectively consider her options and make choices if I intervene against her will for her own good I show less respect for her as a person than if I allow her to make her own mistakes Which is not to say of course that intervention in such cases might not in the end be justified only that something is lost when it is engaged in and what is lost is a degree of interpersonal respect we owe each other However as we saw in the last section this move depends on the determination of basic autonomy and an argument that such a threshold is non arbitrary Also relevant here is the question of procedural versus substantive autonomy as the ground of the prohibition of paternalism For if by autonomy we mean the ability to govern oneself no matter how depraved or morally worthless are the options being exercised it is unclear that the bar to paternalism and respect for persons generally retains its normative force As I mentioned above the response to this challenge must be that the decision making capacity itself is of non derivative value independent of the content of those decisions at least if one wishes to avoid the difficulties of positing a substantive and potentially non neutral conception of autonomy as the basis for interpersonal respect Issues connected to respect for autonomy especially ones that raise questions about paternalism are particularly germane to the field of bioethics where much discussion of the nature of autonomy has taken place This is because respecting patient autonomy has been seen as one of the fundamental pillars of bioethical principles Beauchamp and Childers However the complexities of the cases where appraising client autonomy in order to judge what respect for it requires inevitably give rise to how to conceptualize that notion specifically with regards to whether one adopts a substantive or procedural account On the one hand certain values and aims that patients bring to medical situations for example the aversion to eating on the part of a possibly anorexic patient might by their nature undercut a judgment of competence at the heart of their autonomy hence suggesting a substantive view Some such as Dive and Newson have used observations of this sort to urge a revitalization of substantive accounts of autonomy in such settings while others have resisted that turn See Dive and Newson and see Pugh for a defense of a procedural account for a general discussion of paternalism and health care see Taylor and the essays in Nys et al This is merely a sampling of some of the central ways that the idea of autonomy figures in moral philosophy Not discussed here are areas of applied ethics for example in medical ethics where respect for autonomy grounds such principles as that of informed consent Such contexts illustrate the fundamental value that autonomy generally is thought to represent as expressive of one of the fundamentals of moral personhood The conception of the autonomous person plays a variety of roles in various constructions of liberal political theory for recent discussion see e g Coburn Christman and the essays in Christman and Anderson eds Principally it serves as the model of the person whose perspective is used to formulate and justify political principles as in social contract models of principles of justice Rawls Also and correspondingly it serves as the model of the citizen whose basic interests are reflected in those principles such as in the claim that basic liberties opportunities and other primary goods are fundamental to flourishing lives no matter what moral commitments life plans or other particulars of the person might obtain Kymlicka Waldron Moreover autonomy is ascribed to persons or projected as an ideal in order to delineate and critique oppressive social conditions liberation from which is considered a fundamental goal of justice whether or not those critiques are described as within the liberal tradition or as a specific alternative to it cf Keornahan Cornell Young Maite Stoljar cf also Hirschmann For our purposes here liberalism refers generally to that approach to political power and social justice that determines principles of right justice prior to and largely independent of determination of conceptions of the good though see Liberalism see also Christman ch This implies that the liberal conception of justice and the legitimation of political power more generally can be specified and justified without crucial reference to controversial conceptions of value and moral principles what Rawls calls comprehensive moral conceptions Rawls The fact of permanent pluralism of such moral conceptions is therefore central to liberalism Indeed Colburn argues that a commitment to autonomy understood as an individual s deciding for herself what is valuable and living her life in accordance with that value implies a commitment to anti perfectionist liberalism one centered on pluralism and value relativism The tightrope that views like this must walk is between adopting perfectionism in one sense the view that the state should promote a good namely autonomy but anti perfectionist in another perhaps more important sense that in promoting personal autonomy for citizens the state does not constrain the pursuit of a wide array of other conceptions of the good life Colburn see also Raz and Wall One manner in which debates concerning autonomy directly connect to controversies within and about liberalism concerns the role that state neutrality is to play in the justification and application of principles of justice Neutrality is a controversial standard of course and the precise way in which liberal theory is committed to a requirement of neutrality is complex and controversial see Raz Waldron The question to be asked here is whether the conception of autonomy utilized in liberal theories must itself attempt to be neutral concerning various conceptions of morality and value or alternatively does the reliance on autonomy in the justification and specification of liberal theories of justice render them non neutral simply because of this reliance no matter how neutral the conception of autonomy utilized turns out to be Christman Let us consider this first question concerning neutrality and in so doing revisit the issue of whether the independence implicit in autonomy should best be conceived in a purely procedural manner or more substantively Recall that some theorists view autonomy as requiring minimal competence or rationality along with authenticity where the latter condition is fleshed out in terms of the capacity to reflectively accept motivational aspects of oneself This view can be called proceduralist because it demands that the procedure by which a person comes to identify a desire or trait as her own is what is crucial in the determination of its authenticity and hence autonomy This conception of autonomy is adopted according to its defenders because doing so is the only way to ensure that autonomy is neutral toward all conceptions of value and the good that reasonable adults may come to internalize Dworkin Freyenhage Critics of this view have pointed to cases where it is imagined that persons adopt what most would call oppressive and overly restrictive life situations but in a way that meets the minimal conditions of autonomy on proceduralist accounts so that on such accounts they count as autonomous because of the self governing processes by which they entered such oppressive conditions These critics argue that any conception of autonomy that ascribes that trait to such people is wrongly conceived Benson MacKenzie Stoljar b and Waller and Oshana On the basis of such a judgment they argue that normatively substantive conditions should be added to the requirements of autonomy conditions such as the ability to recognize and follow certain moral or political norms See Benson Wolf for criticism see Berofsky ch This criticism suggests that considerations concerning the autonomous self cannot avoid questions of identity and hence whether the self of self government can be understood independently of the perhaps socially defined values in terms of which people conceive of themselves this is a subject to which we now turn Autonomy as we have been describing it certainly attaches paradigmatically to individual persons it is not in this usage a property of groups or peoples So the autonomy that grounds basic rights and which connects to moral responsibility as this concept is thought to do is assigned to persons without essential reference to other people institutions or traditions within which they may live and act Critics claim however that such a view runs counter to the manner in which most of us or all of us in some ways define ourselves and hence diverges problematically from the aspects of identity that motivate action ground moral commitments and by which people formulate life plans Autonomy it is argued implies the ability to reflect wholly on oneself to accept or reject one s values connections and self defining features and change such elements of one s life at will But we are all not only deeply enmeshed in social relations and cultural patterns we are also defined by such relations some claim Sandel For example we use language to engage in reflection but language is itself a social product and deeply tied to various cultural forms In any number of ways we are constituted by factors that lie beyond our reflective control but which nonetheless structure our values thoughts and motivations Taylor f for discussion see Bell To say that we are autonomous and hence morally responsible bear moral rights etc only when we can step back from all such connections and critically appraise and possibly alter them flies in the face of these psychological and metaphysical realities In a different manner critics have claimed that the liberal conception of the person reflected in standard models of autonomy under emphasizes the deep identity constituting connections we have with gender race culture and religion among other things Such thick identities are not central to the understanding of the self governing person who according to standard liberal models is fully able to abstract from such elements of her self concept and to either identify with or to reject such them But such an ideal too narrowly valorizes the life of the cosmopolitan man the world traveler who freely chooses whether to settle into this or that community identify with this or that group and so on see Young Alcoff and Appiah for discussion see Meyers b These challenges have also focused on the relation of the self to its culture Margalit and Raz Tamir Colburn ch Levey What is at issue from a policy perspective is that emphasis on the individual s self government with the cosmopolitan perspective that this entails makes it difficult if not impossible to ground rights to the protection and internal self government of traditional cultures themselves Kymlicka This is problematic in that it excludes from the direct protection of liberal policies those individuals and groups whose self conceptions and value commitments are deeply constituted by cultural factors Or conversely the assumption that the autonomous person is able to separate himself from all cultural commitments forestalls moves to provide state protection for cultural forms themselves insofar as such state policies rest on the value of autonomy There have been many responses to these charges on behalf of a liberal outlook e g Kymlicka Gutman Appiah for a general response to question of cultural identities see Kymlicka The most powerful response is that autonomy need not require that people be in a position to step away from all of their connections and values and to critically appraise them Mere piecemeal reflection is all that is required As Kymlicka puts it No particular task is set for us by society and no particular cultural practice has authority that is beyond individual judgement and possible rejection Kymlicka There is a clarification that is needed in this exchange however For insofar as defenders of liberal principles based on the value of autonomy claim that all aspects of a person s self concept be subject to alteration in order to manifest autonomy they needlessly exaggerate the commitments of the liberal position For such a view is open to the charge that liberal conceptions fail to take seriously the permanent and unalterable aspects of the self and its social position Young Our embodiment for example is often not something which we can alter other than marginally and numerous other self defining factors such as sexual orientation for some native language culture and race are not readily subject to our manipulation and transformation even in a piecemeal manner To say that we are heteronomous because of this is therefore deeply problematic What must be claimed by the defender of autonomy based liberalism is that the ability in question is to change those aspects of oneself from which one is deeply alienated or with which one does not identify etc For in those cases where upon reflection one experiences one s body culture race or sexuality as an external burden constricting one s more settled and authentic nature and still one cannot alter that factor then one lacks autonomy relative to it see Christman ch But if one feels fully at home within those unalterable parameters one does not lack autonomy because of that unalterability for a different way of approach this issue see Mahmoud Khader Roessler As we said several writers have claimed that proceduralist accounts of autonomy would wrongly attribute autonomy to those whose restricted socialization and stultifying life conditions pressure them into internalizing oppressive values and norms for example women who have internalized the belief in the social authority of husbands or that only by having and raising children are their lives truly complete and the like If such women reflect on these values they may well endorse them even if doing so is free of any specific reflection inhibiting conditions But such women surely lack autonomy it is claimed so only if autonomy includes a requirement that one be able to recognize basic value claims such as the person s own equal moral standing will that concept be useful in describing the oppressive conditions of a patriarchal society see e g Oshana Stoljar for discussion see Christman chap Benson Friedman Meyers These and related considerations have sparked some to develop an alternative approach to autonomy meant to replace allegedly overly individualistic notions This replacement has been called relational autonomy MacKenzie and Stoljar a Spurred by feminist critiques of traditional conceptions of autonomy and rights Nedelsky Code relational conceptions of autonomy stress the ineliminable role that relatedness plays in both persons self conceptions relative to which autonomy must be defined and the dynamics of deliberation and reasoning These views offer a provocative alternative to traditional models of the autonomous individual but it must be made clear what position is being taken on the issue on the one hand relational accounts can be taken as resting on a non individualist conception of the person and then claim that insofar as autonomy is self government and the self is constituted by relations with others then autonomy is relational or these accounts may be understood as claiming that whatever selves turn out to be autonomy fundamentally involves social relations rather than individual traits Oshana Some such views also waiver between claiming that social and personal relations play a crucial causal role in the development and enjoyment of autonomy and claiming that such relations constitute autonomy for discussion see Mackenzie and Stoljar b for a recent overview see Mackenzie Another relational element to autonomy that has been developed connects social support and recognition of the person s status to her capacities for self trust self esteem and self respect The core argument in these approaches is that autonomy requires the ability to act effectively on one s own values either as an individual or member of a social group but that oppressive social conditions of various kinds threaten those abilities by removing one s sense of self confidence required for effective agency Social recognition and or support for this self trusting status is required for the full enjoyment of these abilities see Anderson and Honneth Grovier Benson McCleod and Sherwin and Westlund These claims often are accompanied with a rejection of purportedly value neutral proceduralist accounts of autonomy even those that attempt to accommodate a fully social conception of the self One question that arises with relational views connected to self trust in this way why exactly are such relations seen as conceptually constitutive of autonomy rather than contributory to it and its development where the self confidence or self trust in question is the core element to which these sorts of social relations are an important albeit contingent contributor Another question to be considered arises from those cases where self trust is established despite lack of social recognition as when runaway slaves manage to heroically push on with their quest for freedom while facing violent denials from surrounding others and surrounding social structures that they enjoy the status of a full human being capable of authentic decision making Finally self trust is not always merited consider the brash teenager who insists on exercising social independence based on her unwarranted confidence in her abilities to make good judgments see Mackenzie n Development of relational accounts of autonomy have often been part of a critical project of analyzing the possibilities of self government under non ideal indeed overtly oppressive conditions Largely from a feminist perspective though not confined to that these analyses have insisted that our understanding of autonomy must take into account the pronounced inequality of power and cultural domination that marks most of the social world and some use this as a starting point in criticizing certain models for example purely procedural accounts of self government for implying that those who are forced to embrace the identities and value structures of those oppressive environments will count as autonomous See Stoljar for a response to this criticism see Maite and Roessler on the question of adaptive preference formation see Khader and Terlazzo However Khader and McGill argue that debates over procedural versus substantive accounts of autonomy embedded in discussions of relational views often result in people talking past each other That is defenders of substantive accounts are often engaged in a kind of ameliorative theorizing finding the most powerful conceptualization of concepts like autonomy to best express the need for liberation while proceduralists analyze the concept with reference to competing points of view including that of victims of oppression whose autonomy is in question to achieve a kind of reflective equilibrium about the concept See Khader and McGill Nevertheless these approaches have all importantly shifted philosophical attention concerning autonomy to the social and interpersonal dynamics that shape its enjoyment connecting ideas about autonomy with broader issues of social justice recognition and social practices This brings us back then to considerations of the liberal project and its potential limitations where autonomy remains central As noted earlier there are various versions of liberal political philosophy All of them however are committed to a conception of political legitimacy in which political power and authority is justified only if such authority is acceptable to all citizens bound by it see Rawls This connects to a broader view of the foundations of value that at least some liberal theorists present as central to that tradition That is the claim that values are valid for a person only if those values are or can be reasonably endorsed by the person in question By extension principles guiding the operation of institutions of social and political power what Rawls calls the institutions of the basic structure Rawls are legitimate only if they can be endorsed in this way by those subject to them In this way liberalism in most of its forms is committed to what some have called the endorsement constraint Kymlicka f R Dworkin Models of autonomy considered above include a condition that mirrors this constraint in that a person is autonomous relative to some action guiding norm or value only if upon critical reflection of that value she identifies with it approves of it or does not feel deeply alienated from it Combining this view with the endorsement constraint liberalism carries the implication that autonomy is respected only when guiding values or principles in a society can be embraced in some way by those governed by them This will connect directly to the liberal theory of legitimacy to be discussed below Perfectionists reject this set of claims Perfectionism is the view that there are values valid for an individual or a population even when from the subjective point of view of those agents or groups that value is not endorsed or accepted Wall Sumner Hurka Sher see also Perfectionism In short it is the view that there are entirely objective values While there are perfectionist liberals this view generally resists the liberal claim that the autonomous acceptance of the central components of political principles is a necessary condition for the legitimacy of those principles Moreover perfectionists question the liberal commitment to neutrality in the formulation and application of political principles Hurka Perfectionists specifically target the liberal connection between respect for autonomy and neutrality of political principles Wall For many liberalism rests on the value of individual autonomy but this reliance either assumes that respect for autonomy is merely one value among others in the liberal view or autonomy has overriding value In either case however neutrality is not supported If autonomy is merely one value among others for example then there will clearly be times when state support of those other values will override respect for autonomy paternalistic restrictions imposed to promote citizen safety for example Sher Hurka Conly On the other hand autonomy could be seen as an absolute constraint on the promotion of values or more plausibly as a constitutive condition of the validity of all values for a person as the endorsement constraint implies Perfectionists reply however that this is itself a controversial value position one that may not find unqualified general support Hurka Sher Sumner cf Griffin To answer these objections one must turn to consideration of the liberal principle of legitimacy For the claim that liberals make concerning the limits of state promotion of the good a limit set by respect for autonomy depends heavily on their view about the ultimate ground of political power Liberalism is generally understood to arise historically out of the social contract tradition of political philosophy and hence rests on the idea of popular sovereignty The concept of autonomy then figures centrally in at least one dominant strand in this tradition the strand the runs through the work of Kant The major alternative version of the liberal tradition sees popular sovereignty as basically a collective expression of rational choice and that the principles of the basic institutions of political power are merely instrumental in the maximization of aggregate citizen welfare or as with Mill a constitutive element of welfare broadly considered But it is the Kantian brand of liberalism that places autonomy of persons at center stage Rawls s Theory of Justice was seen as the contemporary manifestation of this Kantian approach to justice where justice was conceived as those principles that would be chosen under conditions of unbiased rational decision making from behind the veil of ignorance The original position where such principles would be chosen was said by Rawls to mirror Kant s Categorical Imperative That is it is a device in which persons can choose principles to impose upon themselves in a way which is independent of contingencies of social position race sex or conception of the good Rawls But as is well known the Kantian foundations of Rawls s theory of justice rendered it vulnerable to the charge that it was inapplicable to those populations all modern populations in fact where deep moral pluralism abounds For under such conditions no theory of justice which rests on a metaphysically grounded conception of the person could claim full allegiance from members of a population whose deep diversity causes them to disagree about metaphysics itself as well as about moral frameworks and conceptions of value related to it For this reason Rawls developed a new or further developed understanding of the foundations of his version of liberalism a political conception Rawls Under political liberalism autonomy of persons is postulated not as a metaphysically grounded fact about moral personality or practical reason as such but rather as one of several device s of representation under which diverse citizens can focus on the methods of derivation such as the original position for substantive principles of justice Rawls Justice is achieved only when an overlapping consensus among people moved by deeply divergent but reasonable comprehensive moral views can be attained a consensus in which such citizens can affirm principles of justice from within those comprehensive views Political Liberalism shifts the focus from a philosophical conception of justice formulated abstractly and meant to apply universally to a practical conception of legitimacy where consensus is reached without pretension of deep metaphysical roots for the principles in question More than merely a modus vivendi for the participating parties justice must be affirmed in a way that finds a moral basis for all participating citizens albeit from different frameworks of value and moral obligation The operation of public reason then serves as the means by which such a consensus might be established and hence public discussion and democratic institutions must be seen as a constitutive part of the justification of principles of justice rather than merely a mechanism for the collective determination of the social good But the role of autonomy in the specification of this picture should not be under emphasized or the controversies it invites ignored For such a consensus counts as legitimate only when achieved under conditions of free and authentic affirmation of shared principles Only if the citizens see themselves as fully able to reflectively endorse or reject such shared principles and to do so competently and with adequate information and range of options can the overlapping political consensus step beyond the purely strategic dynamics of a modus vivendi and ground legitimate institutions of political power See A Taylor Indeed the assumption that all those subject to political authority enjoy the developed capacity to reflectively accept their life path and the values inherent in it invokes a level of idealization that belies the conditions of many victims of past and ongoing oppression This virtually ensures that such structural conditions of society as racial domination profound inequality of power and patterns of exclusion of groups from equal standing in social space will be assumed away as irrelevant to the question of legitimacy Mills Therefore social conditions that hamper the equal enjoyment of capacities to reflectively consider and if necessary reject principles of social justice due say to extreme poverty disability ongoing injustice and inequality or the like restrict the establishment of just principles Autonomy then insofar as that concept picks out the free reflective choice operating in the establishment of legitimacy is basic to and presupposed by even such non foundational political conceptions of justice Critics of political liberalism arise from several quarters However among the objections to it that focus on autonomy are those that question whether a political conception of legitimacy that rests on shared values can be sustained without the validity of those values being seen as somehow objective or fundamental a position that clashes with the purported pluralism of political liberalism Otherwise citizens with deeply conflicting worldviews could not be expected to affirm the value of autonomy except as a mere modus vivendi see e g Wall cf also Larmore A line of response to this worry that could be pursued would be one that claimed that values that amount to autonomy in some conceptualization of that idea are already functional in the social structures and cultural practices of otherwise defensible democratic practices as well as some critical projects that emphasize oppression and domination as we saw above This point raises the issue to which we now turn of the connection between autonomy political liberalism and democracy In closing we should add a word about the implications of political liberalism for the traditional division between liberal justice and democratic theory I say division here but different views of justice and democracy will convey very different conceptions of the relation between the two see Christiano Lakoff But traditionally liberal conceptions of justice have viewed democratic mechanisms of collective choice as essential but highly circumscribed by the constitutional provisions that principles of justice support Individual rights and freedoms equality before the law and various privileges and protections associated with citizen autonomy are protected by principles of justice and hence not subject to democratic review on this approach Gutmann However liberal conceptions of justice have themselves evolved in some strains at least to include reference to collective discussion and debate public reason among the constitutive conditions of legitimacy It could be claimed then that basic assumptions about citizens capacities for reflective deliberation and choice autonomy must be part of the background conditions against which an overlapping consensus or other sort of political agreement concerning principles of justice is to operate For discussion see Claassen Some thinkers have made the connection between individual or private autonomy and collective or public legitimacy prominent most notably Habermas Habermas On this view legitimacy and justice cannot be established in advance through philosophical construction and argument as was thought to be the case in natural law traditions in which classical social contract theory flourished and which is inherited in different form in contemporary perfectionist liberal views Rather justice amounts to that set of principles that are established in practice and rendered legitimate by the actual support of affected citizens and their representatives in a process of collective discourse and deliberation see e g Fraser and Young Systems of rights and protections private individual autonomy will necessarily be protected in order to institutionalize frameworks of public deliberation and more specifically legislation and constitutional interpretation that render principles of social justice acceptable to all affected in consultation with others Habermas This view of justice if at all acceptable provides an indirect defense of the protection of autonomy and in particular conceptualizing autonomy in a way that assumes reflective self evaluation For only if citizen participants in the public discourse that underlies justice are assumed to have and provided the basic resources for having capacities for competent self reflection can the public defense and discussion of competing conceptions of justice take place cf Gaus Parts II and III Gaus Insofar as autonomy is necessary for a functioning democracy considered very broadly and the latter is a constitutive element of just political institutions then autonomy must be seen as reflective self appraisal and I would add non alienation from central aspects of one s person see Cohen Richardson Christman This approach to justice and autonomy spelled out here in rough and general form has certainly faced criticism In particular those theorists concerned with the multi dimensional nature of social and cultural difference have stressed how the conception of the autonomous person assumed in such principles as well as criteria for rational discourse and public deliberation is a contestable ideal not internalized by all participants in contemporary political life see e g Brown Benhabib Others motivated by post modern considerations concerning the nature of the self rationality language and identity are also suspicious of the manner in which the basic concepts operative in liberal theories of justice autonomy for example are understood as fixed transparent and without their own political presuppositions see e g Butler for general discussion see White These charges are stated here much too generally to give an adequate response in this context But the challenge remains for any theory of justice which rests on a presumption of the normative centrality of autonomy To be plausible in a variously pluralistic social setting one marked by ongoing histories of oppressive practices and institutions such a view must avoid the twin evils of forcibly imposing a reasonably contested value on resistant citizens on the one hand and simply abandoning all normative conceptions of social order in favor of open ended struggle for power on the other The view that individuals ought to be treated as and given the resources to become autonomous in one of the minimal senses outlined here will I submit be a central element in any political view that steers between the Scylla of oppressive forms of perfectionism and the Charybdis of interest group power politics autonomy personal communitarianism feminist philosophy topics perspectives on the self free will identity

China s latest move to refine how mutual funds measure and evaluate performance marks a shift toward a more disciplined quality oriented capital market experts said They added that this would make fund managers more accountable and better align investment practices with investor interests The comments came after the China Securities Regulatory Commission unveiled a draft guideline on Friday to enhance the role of performance benchmarks in regulating mutual fund investments by standardizing the selection and use of such benchmarks The draft is open for public feedback until Nov Sources said the reform will bring China s mutual fund performance benchmark system generally in line with international standards while featuring a regulatory requirement that links fund managers compensation to fund performance relative to benchmarks Under the draft guideline performance benchmarks must reflect a fund s core strategy and investment style as defined in its contract and cannot be changed arbitrarily Fund management companies must establish comprehensive internal controls to maintain stable investment styles It also emphasizes the role of benchmarks in performance evaluations and calls for strengthened information disclosure and oversight by fund custodians Regulators will guide the industry through a one year transition period to ensure existing products adjust their benchmarks smoothly avoiding market disruption Analysts said that previously a lack of systematic rules led to deviations in some actively managed equity funds affecting investor returns Once implemented the new guideline will fill regulatory gaps promote clearer investment styles better protect investors and help attract long term capital Managers of actively managed equity funds whose long term performance significantly lags behind benchmarks will see a marked reduction in performance based pay according to the draft guideline This aligns with an action plan released by the CSRC in May to foster high quality development of the mutual fund industry According to the plan managers whose over three year results fall more than percentage points below the benchmark would see a notable cut in performance based compensation while those who outperform significantly may receive appropriate rewards The Asset Management Association of China the self regulatory organization for the mutual fund industry will soon issue supporting self discipline measures to facilitate this compensation mechanism sources said The association has released draft operational details to implement the overall reform zhoulanxv chinadaily com cn

The Andalusian philosopher physician and judge Ibn Rushd is one of the great figures of philosophy within the Muslim contexts and a foundational source for post classical European thought The hallmarks of Ibn Rushd s work are his convictions that philosophy is capable of demonstrative certainty in many domains that it is Aristotle who should be our preeminent guide in philosophy and that philosophy should play a central role within religious inquiry rather than being an alternative to religion But part of what gives his ideas their enduring interest is the subtle way in which he promotes other methods of reasoning and persuasion in contexts where the rigors of Aristotelian demonstration are not a practical option To grasp Ibn Rushd s thought in full requires attending not only to the Aristotelian commentaries where he attempts to develop philosophy as a demonstrative science but also to areas like religion medicine and law where constraints of both subject matter and audience require other argumentative and rhetorical techniques Often improperly referred to as Averroes the corrupted form his name took in Latin Ibn Rushd quickly achieved such prominence in later European thought as to rival the influence of Aristotle himself whose works Ibn Rushd tirelessly championed Most modern scholarship orients itself around his reception in Christian Europe where he was known simply as the Commentator and so fails to appreciate Ibn Rushd s own distinctive philosophical achievements Ab al Wal d Mu ammad ibn Ahmad Ibn Rushd was born in Cordova in He belonged to an influential Andalusian family famous for its judicial power and for its scholarship in the religious sciences His father was a prominent judge but the most important figure in the family was his grandfather who also bears his name Ibn Rushd and so the philosopher is called the grandson al af d to distinguish him from his grandfather al jadd The latter was both a well known judge and a famed jurist being the author of many books in jurisprudence following the M lik school Unlike Ibn S n and al Ghaz l Ibn Rushd did not write an autobiography and as a result many aspects of his life are obscure and will remain so unless new documents are discovered The limited information we have from his biographers unanimously agrees on his good conduct his diligence in science and his fairness as a judge while noting his interests in philosophy and his adoption of certain audacious views The surviving historical sources tell us much about his teachers in the religious sciences but with the exception of medicine we know little about those who taught him in other fields He was certainly not a disciple of either of his famous Andalusian contemporaries Ibn B jja or Ibn Tufayl although he read their philosophical works Puig and Ben Shar fa discuss the intellectual circles around Ibn Rushd Ibn Rushd was when the Almohads came to power in the western Maghreb and Andalusia Given that the Ibn Rushds had been prominent in circles close to the previous Almoravid dynasty it was imperative for the grandson to express in his writings and perhaps even in person his commitment to the new rulers and the Almohad creed da wa conceptualized by Mu ammad Ibn T mart d Some surviving testimonies suggest that Ibn Rushd did in fact adopt Ibn T mart s creed at some point in his life see Ben Shar fa Given the social position of his family Ibn Rushd soon found himself in the ruling circles of Marrakesh and close to the princes or at least some of them in Andalusia He engaged in debates on philosophical and theological issues with this inner circle and there is a record of a meeting with Ab Ya q b Y suf r the second Almohad ruler who officially asked Ibn Rushd to comment on Aristotle s works and render them accessible Later he became chief physician to the caliph in Marrakesh Nevertheless Ibn Rushd s relationship with the Almohad creed was complex and seems to have evolved Geoffroy Ben Ahmed c Recently discovered revisions to his al Kashf an man hij al adilla contain paragraphs where Ibn Rushd shows a sort of critical distance towards Ibn Tumart s creed These paragraphs when added to his harsh criticism of the Almohads in his commentary on Plato s Republic may help us understand the evolution he underwent during his intellectual life They may shed light in particular on the disgrace he suffered at the end of his career when for reasons that remain unclear he fell out of favor with the Almohads and was exiled in Lucena km southeast of Cordova According to one account his death took place while he was confined to a residence in Marrakesh in The definitive biography in Arabic is Ben Shar fa For more on the historical context see Urvoy and Ben Ahmed c Ibn Rushd remained productive for at least four decades He was the author of a large corpus that extends over medicine logic and philosophy in all its branches including natural philosophy astronomy metaphysics psychology politics and ethics His work also includes the sciences of Islamic religion jurisprudence fiqh the foundations of Islamic law us l al fiqh the foundations of religion us l al d n and the science of the Arabic language including grammar With important exceptions most of his works are available in the original Arabic For those works that have been lost while readers await the day of their rediscovery they must generally make do with medieval translations in Hebrew or Latin Ibn Rushd s work deploys various methods and styles Many treatises are in the form of a commentary most famously and extensively on Aristotle covering nearly the whole Aristotelian corpus but also on Galen s medical treatises as well as on other philosophers such as Plato Ibn S n and Ibn B jja Many other treatises devoted to specific issues are not in commentary form For a detailed inventory of texts and translations see The focus of his commentaries was Aristotle because no one has yet surpassed his achievement no one who has come after him to this our time and this is close to years later has been able to add a word worthy of attention to what he said LongPhys proem Harvey Scholarship going back to the nineteenth century has divided the commentaries into three kinds Inasmuch as Ibn Rushd routinely wrote different kinds of commentaries on the same Aristotelian treatise some such distinction seems necessary But recent scholarship has doubted whether this neat threefold distinction adequately captures Ibn Rushd s complexly varied approach Al Alaw a Druart Gutas At a minimum it omits important categories of work such as compendia mukhta arat treatises maq l t and answers to questions mas il to say nothing of the important treatises that focus on religious questions The most prominent of those independent religious treatises are These works which seem to have had little influence on medieval Christian thought have traditionally been seen as theological and contrasted with his supposedly philosophical works the commentaries on Aristotle that circulated throughout medieval and Renaissance Europe in Latin and Hebrew translation The latter were thought to be demonstrative and aimed at the elites whereas the former were said to be merely dialectical and so aimed at a popular audience Accordingly Ibn Rushd s true position supposedly had to be sought in these Aristotelian commentaries This distinction has affected the direction of scholarship causing great attention to be given to the philosophical works which were thought to represent most truly his thought and leaving the theological treatises to be comparatively neglected Even where the latter are widely taught they are set apart from his supposedly more philosophical commentaries The result ever since the initial research of Renan has been a segmented and fragmentary view of the Rushdian corpus that marginalizes important aspects of his thought An important correction to this tendency appears in Jamal Al D n Al Alaw a who defends the unity and coherence of the Rushdian corpus He proposes that Ibn Rushd s works form a unity where there is no room to distinguish between what is a commentary on another text and what is an ostensibly original work With this Al Alaw attempted to close a gap in a body of work that should rightly be seen as continuous and to reconnect texts that have been disassociated from their contexts The general character of Ibn Rushd s philosophy is illuminated by his overarching picture of logic Most broadly he understands it as the study of the conditions and rules that rightly guide the mind toward the conception ta awwur of essences and the assent ta d q to propositions CompLogic Glossing Aristotle s famous remark that it is the mark of the educated person to seek the appropriate level of precision in any inquiry Ibn Rushd clarifies that the educated person is one who has been instructed in the art of logic ParaEthics I C In keeping with the weight he accords the subject Ibn Rushd commented several times on each work in Aristotle s logical Organon Near the start of his career he wrote a Compendium of Logic that includes Porphyry s Isagoge and follows the usual Arabic practice of including the Rhetoric and Poetics as part of an expanded Organon Black Later he wrote a series of longer paraphrases of this same corpus but treated the Isagoge separately on the grounds that it is neither an introduction to nor even a part of logic Toward the end of his life he devoted one of his five long commentaries to the Posterior Analytics In line with the approach of his predecessors Ibn Rushd divided logical processes into five types of argument demonstrative dialectical rhetorical poetical and fallacious These inferences are not distinguished by their forms which are the same but by their matter that is by their premises The premises of demonstrative arguments are necessary Thom the premises of dialectical arguments are generally accepted the premises of rhetoric are generally received the premises of poetic arguments are imaginative and the premises of sophistical arguments are deceiving For Ibn Rushd the center of logic and its very purpose is demonstration for it is the only procedure that leads to certainty in philosophy it is the most perfect kind of reflection na ar using the most perfect kind of inference qiy s Decisive Treatise Accordingly even in the context of Plato s Republic he begins his commentary by announcing that his goal is to abstract such scientific arguments attributable to Plato as are contained in the Republic by removing from it its dialectical arguments However this does not mean that non demonstrative arguments are useless Generally where one kind of argument is not effective other kinds of arguments should be used Dialectic offers a path toward demonstration and to science which although it does not obtain certainty is close to it Rhetoric contributes through its paradigms and enthymemes to reinforcing and promoting demonstrative evidence The study of sophistical reasoning is useful in assessing the faulty argumentative methods of the theologians the mutakallim n that is practitioners of kal m In light of the high status of demonstration Ibn Rushd considered it with great care in his commentaries He devoted a compendium a paraphrase and a long commentary to the Posterior Analytics which he calls the Book of Demonstration Kit b al Burh n and wrote separate treatises on various special issues The long commentary is probably the most appropriate text for his positions on the components of demonstration its types and its role in producing scientific knowledge That commentary is also the occasion for a critical and severe interaction with the two Islamic authorities in logic before him al F r b and Ibn S n The purpose of examining demonstrative arguments is to understand the absolute demonstration that gives complete certainty and constitutes a science LongPostAn I There are however other kinds of demonstration less certain than the absolute one but still demonstrative In all Ibn Rushd distinguishes three types LongPostAn I In mathematics it is generally possible to frame absolute demonstrations because the premises both supply the cause and are better known than their conclusions In the natural sciences however and even in metaphysics this ideal situation is generally not achievable Here we begin with the accidental sensible features of things and so extensive use must be made of the demonstration of existence EpiPhys Sylla Cerami Ibn S n whose views are often the target of Ibn Rushd s logic had denied that these count as a demonstration at all on the grounds that they establish no substantial connection between the posterior cause and the prior effect Ibn Rushd rejects this view LongPostAn I but admits that the demonstration of existence is less reliable than the other demonstrations Certainty comes in degrees and the differentiation in certainty between these demonstrations is one of the reasons why some sciences are superior to others ParaPostAn Ibn Rushd s enthusiasm for demonstration does not prevent him from valuing other logical arts and he was particularly concerned with the place of dialectic Broadly speaking according to Aristotle dialectic has three main uses as intellectual training as a path into the demonstrative sciences of philosophy and as a means of conversing with ordinary people Topics I But Ibn Rushd devotes less space and shows less interest in this third feature of dialectic and one wonders whether this is due to his critical reaction to the discursive practices of the mutakallim n Despite the many considerations that make dialectic more suitable when dealing with ordinary people Ibn Rushd suggests that rhetorical and poetic statements are preferable ParaTop I C Ben Ahmed Hence their inclusion in the expanded Organon The significance of rhetoric and poetics is a result he establishes in political science but maintains even when it comes to teaching and anchoring theological truths The bad example set by the dialectical syllogisms of the mutakallim n shows how dialectical methods in discussion with ordinary people are actually disadvantageous Under the influence of al F r b Ibn Rushd puts emphasis on the need to introduce dialectic as a method ar q a set of rules techniques and warnings Ben Ahmed a This conception of dialectic makes it distinct from both demonstration and sophistical reasoning as well as from ordinary conversations When used well dialectic is a communal enterprise and so again different from other arts such as demonstration where there is no need for more than one party A successful partnership in dialectic is one where each party does their best to commit themselves to the rules From this perspective it becomes evident that the questioner is not simply an adversary seeking to defeat his opponent but rather a partner and a collaborator with the respondent in the search for knowledge Any debate that is motivated by the pursuit of victory or by deriving pleasure from defeating one s opponent is a debate that cannot fall under the method of dialectic He writes the communal enterprise al amal al mushtarak can be achieved in its utmost perfection only by both partners They can have something in common when their aim is the assessment and the deduction of the truth or the realization of their training Thus the respondent should perfect his response if he intends that aim because the basest of the partners is the one who aims at the obstruction of the communal enterprise But if their aim is to struggle against and defeat the other then they will have nothing in common This is not the method of dialectic ParaTop D Ben Ahmed a At the far reaches of the logical arts the connection to the genuine syllogism becomes remote So even while Ibn Rushd recognizes that poetics is a syllogistic art he says that it lacks the power of a real syllogism and is thus unproductive CompLogic In his paraphrase of the Poetics he avoids using the term poetic syllogism altogether In the realm of jurisprudence Ibn Rushd is famous for his position on the logical and epistemological value of juridical inferences which in his view produce nothing more than opinion ann Even when confronted with the surprising insertion of the word for jurisprudence fiqh into the Arabic translation of the Prior Analytics b Ibn Rushd chooses totally to ignore it In his juridical writings he openly denies the accuracy of the term syllogism qiy s for what jurists had become accustomed to calling their juridical inferences al maq y s al fiqhiyya or qiy s shar When jurists speak of qiy s it is important to recognize that the term bears quite a different meaning Abridgement Bou Akl In particular contrary to what happens in the syllogism the qiy s of the jurists does not have the power to deduce the unknown from the known And even in those cases where Ibn Rushd seems to accept juridical inference he does not make use of logical vocabulary but instead deploys the terms used by most of the jurists before him Rather than engage in a syllogistification of the juridical inference he focuses on the semantic and linguistic origins of juridical rules For Ibn Rushd every science has its own characteristics therefore anyone who tried to study logic while studying jurisprudence would fail at studying both Abridgement The divisions between metaphysics natural philosophy psychology and theology are permeable for Ibn Rushd and the systematic character of his thought makes it difficult to treat any part in isolation See the start of EpiMeta for his division of the sciences Here our method of proceeding is to begin with the most general principles of being and then to turn in the next section to their causal relationships Of the various kinds of being substances are what exist in the most proper sense EpiMeta Among substances the most familiar are concrete individuals like dogs and stones EpiMeta But these are composite entities and since the principles of a substance are themselves even more properly considered to be substances EpiMeta LongAnima II the most fundamental substances in the sensible realm are the metaphysical ingredients of composite substances matter and form LongMeta VII Underlying all change and enduring through it is homogeneous matter defined simply by its potentiality that is its potential to serve as subject for any earthly form SubstOrb Conceived of without form it is perpetually enduring and numerically one everywhere all transient bodies share this body that is numerically one SubstOrb because it is deprived of the divisions of individual forms LongMeta XII Ibn Rushd worries in predictable ways about the reality of this so called prime matter m dda l On the one hand he consistently counts it as a substance e g ParaAnima On the other hand matter so conceived is a pure privation and does not exist outside of the soul LongMeta XII He offers the less than perspicuous compromise formula that prime matter lies halfway as it were between absolute non being and actual being quasi medium inter non esse simpliciter et esse in actu LongPhys I ParaPhys I Matter exists only when actualized by form but the first form it receives is not the nature of the composite substance dog stone etc but instead the indeterminate dimensions al ab d ghayr al ma d dat that give matter its corporeal character the three dimensions that constitute the nature of body are the first state in matter and matter cannot be devoid of them in any instance of generation not that they exist in matter in actuality but rather in some kind of potentiality different from the potentiality in which matter is constituted ParaGC I SubstOrb In postulating a persisting extended substratum beneath all physical change Ibn Rushd has been said to take a step toward the res extensa of seventeenth century mechanical philosophy Hyman But his conception of matter far from making further forms unnecessary explains how multiple forms can be instantiated in the same material stuff the presence of dimension in prime matter is a prerequisite for the existence of contraries EpiMeta Since forms by their nature are always individuals universals Ibn Rushd insists do not exist outside the soul EpiMeta the theory does not require a principle of individuation for form Extended matter does however serve as what might be called a principle of multiplication If the material realm were not extended there would exist in it only one form at a given time SubstOrb Di Giovanni Alongside matter the other internal principle of composite substances is form and so form too counts as a substance LongAnima II and indeed is substance in the most proper sense of the term Amerini Di Giovanni Substantial forms can be distinguished from accidents in that a subject a dog a stone endures through the gain and loss of its accidents whereas when the substantial form of the subject departs the subject ceases to exist or exists only homonymously ParaAnima as one might speak of cremating one s grandfather Interpreters have disagreed on whether Ibn Rushd allows a single substance to have multiple substantial forms But at least sometimes he seems to suppose that one substance has just one form as when he holds that if prime matter were to have its own form it would receive no other form while enduring but would immediately be corrupted as soon as that other form were generated LongPhys I see SubstOrb If elsewhere he seems to suggest that any necessary feature of a thing will count as a substantial form of it this may mean merely that a substantial form is a composite of multiple discrete incomplete constituents Di Giovanni Cerami Ibn Rushd is clear at any rate that the essence dh t or quiddity m hiyya of a thing is accounted for entirely by its form rather than by its form and matter LongMeta VII Thus form is the primary substance only because it is the cause of the determinate substance and the determinate substances come to be substance only by it LongMeta VII k Accidents which can come and go from a substance are inseparable from that substance and are caused by it EpiMeta LongMeta XII but are not themselves a part of the substance LongAnima II Tah fut I They do not have existence in an absolute sense but only relationally LongMeta XII EpiMeta and indeed Ibn Rushd generally does not refer to them as a form ra preferring to reserve that term for the substantial form The earthly realm we have been describing is just one small and relatively insignificant part of what there is Much more exalted and a much worthier subject of intellectual contemplation is the eternal heavenly domain Here Ibn Rushd broadly follows standard premodern cosmology in describing the eight celestial spheres of the moon the sun the five planets and the fixed stars These spheres are solid transparent bodies spinning around the earth luminous only at those points where the sphere thickens SubstOrb Celestial bodies are composites of matter and form but of an utterly different kind Their matter is actually existent incorruptible and indivisible with a determinate size and shape SubstOrb LongMeta XII Celestial matter is in potentiality only with regard to motion and that motion although generally circular is extremely complex with as many as distinct motions identifiable among the eight spheres LongMeta XII Each of these distinct motions requires a distinct actualizing form EpiMeta LongMeta XII but these are not material forms inhering in the celestial matter since that matter is already actualized Instead these celestial forms are separate and like all forms not inhering in matter they are therefore intellectual if there are these forms that have existence inasmuch as they are not in matter then these are necessarily separate intellects since there is no third kind of existence for forms qua forms EpiMeta Incoherence I In addition to intellects these forms have desires and indeed are aptly referred to as souls LongMeta XII SubstOrb It is this desire rather than any sort of physical contact that moves the spheres with the beauty of its celestial intelligence serving as a final cause and its desire efficiently moving the sphere Far from being cold bodies in empty space these spheres are alive full of pleasure and delighted in themselves EpiMeta Adding to their delight is their partial understanding of and desire for the first and unmoved mover which moves all of the spheres through their desire for this highest cause LongMeta XII EpiMeta For this cosmology in its historical context see Wolfson and Endress The previous section followed the order of discovery beginning with what is better known to us Here we start with what is causally prior and so begin with the First Cause On Ibn Rushd s method of inquiry see Cerami ch Although the existence of some kind of First Cause was undisputed religious and philosophical authorities disagreed about the nature of creation The most common view was that the world came into existence from God after having not existed but Ibn Rushd follows Aristotle in supposing that the world has always existed eternally His strategy for explaining how an eternal world can have a First Cause turns on distinguishing between two kinds of causal orderings essential and accidental Causes that are essentially ordered are simultaneous such that the prior stages are a condition for the effect s ongoing existence as when waves move a ship the wind moves the waves and the wind is moved by elemental forces QPhys Incoherence I In such a series there must be a first cause because an endless such series would be actually infinite all at once which Ibn Rushd regards as impossible Incoherence I The series could moreover never reach its end since causal agency cannot pass through an infinitely long series in a finite time LongPhys VII QPhys This First Cause cannot itself be something in motion given the Aristotelian dictum that everything that is in motion must be moved by another LongPhys VII QPhys In principle Ibn Rushd allows that there could be many unmoved movers QPhys but at a minimum there must be one such thing that is immovable and eternally so because otherwise some still prior mover would be required to move the supposedly first mover and this would lead again to an essentially ordered infinity of movers EpiMeta For the intricate details see Twetten An accidental ordering takes place over time as when rain comes from a cloud the cloud comes from vapor and vapor comes from a prior rain Incoherence I Such an ordering is circular inasmuch as the materials from one stage are corrupted and reused in a later stage and so there is no threat of an actual infinity There is thus nothing incoherent about such a series extending infinitely far into the past and infinitely far into the future and indeed Ibn Rushd argues that such an infinity can be proved in various ways Davidson One fundamental proof arises from the nature of the First Cause Since it is itself unmoved that is wholly changeless its causal agency must likewise be eternal A thing lacking the potential for change and alteration cannot be changed at any time since if it were then its alteration would be by cause of itself and so there would be alteration without the possibility for it LongCaelo I It is for Ibn Rushd incoherent to posit an eternally existing changeless actuality which suddenly springs into agency after having not acted for an eternity In general the effect of a cause cannot be delayed after the causation Incoherence I Similar considerations show that the world s future existence must likewise be eternal Incoherence For the reasons just rehearsed an eternal and unchanging First Mover entails an eternal and unchanging first thing moved and observation suggests that this must be the outermost sphere of the stars whose diurnal rotation in turn moves everything within its ambit there is a moved thing that is first by nature which moves the whole and which terminates every movement whose mover is external The mover of this first moved thing is of itself not a body and is absolutely and essentially unmoved EpiPhys Past this first ceaseless motion the causal story becomes increasingly complex under the influence of the celestial intelligences Ibn Rushd is suspicious of the unrealistic convolutions of Ptolemaic cosmology preferring to honor the principles of Aristotelian physics even where that leaves a gap between theory and observation Sabra Endress A strikingly personal remark describes how he had once aspired to close that gap but has now in his old age abandoned the project LongMeta XII Anticipating the modern rise of scientific specialization he yields the field to those who devote themselves solely to this one science LongMeta XII The spheres move eternally in majestic circles simply because it befits their lofty existence to do so EpiMeta LongMeta XII Incoherence I but these motions have a subordinate effect of signal importance to us they sustain the very existence of our sublunary world Most basically the motion of the celestial spheres although they are not themselves hot SubstOrb gives rise to heat in the fiery region immediately beneath the lunar sphere and from heat and its contrary cold arise the four elements earth air fire water The existence of the celestial body entails necessarily the existence of the elements as preserving efficient formal and final cause EpiMeta Incoherence I The bodies that furnish our sublunary realm are various elemental mixtures in which the elements themselves endure in an attenuated state as the material strata above prime matter EpiMeta LongCaelo III EpiGC I see Maier ch The qualities of these elements hot cold wet dry are the causes of all natural things that come into being and pass away Incoherence II The entire system so depends on the celestial spheres that if the motion of the heavens were destroyed the world in its totality would be destroyed SubstOrb Kashf Matter is at least potentially infinitely divisible but at the level of elements and mixed bodies we can refer to the smallest body capable of still being a body of that kind the minimum naturale e g the minimal possible magnitude of fire EpiPhys Glasner ch Cerami Any sort of mixed body requires a substantial form to actualize it but Ibn Rushd s view of how such forms emerge evolves His early works hold that at least at the level of living things substantial forms cannot be generated by wholly natural processes but require a celestial giver of forms the Agent Intellect EpiMeta His later view is more thoroughly naturalistic and argues that prime matter contains the potentiality for all substantial forms which need only be actualized by a natural agent along with the usual cooperation of the celestial bodies LongMeta VII XII see Davidson ch Freudenthal Cerami chs Ibn Rushd s naturalistic conception of generation and corruption is of a piece with one of his most famous philosophical stances his rejection of al Ghaz l s occasionalism On this theological tradition when a man moves a stone by leaning against it and pushing it he does not push it but it is the Agent who creates the motion LongMeta XII Ibn Rushd heaps scorn on this view in the Incoherence resting his case most fundamentally on the link between a thing s causal role and its defining nature it is self evident that things have essences and attributes that determine the special functions of each thing and through which the essences and names of things are differentiated If a thing did not have its specific nature it would not have a special name nor a definition and all things would be one II For discussion of this argument see Kogan ch For further details see the entry on Ibn Rushd s natural philosophy and the entry on causation in Arabic and Islamic thought In the Aristotelian tradition Ibn Rushd postulates a special sort of substantial form a soul to account for living substances Even in the mundane case of plants the complexities of their operations require a special principle beyond what would be adequate for nonliving things nutrition for instance is ascribed to the soul because it is impossible for it to be ascribed to the powers of the elements LongAnima II His theory of the soul s operations distinguishes most basically between the nutritive sensory and rational levels Judging from his casually flexible terminology he sees no real difference between treating these as different souls within a single living thing or as parts of a single soul parts characterized as a power quwwa or principle mabda Judging again from his varying formulations he thinks there can be no definitive list of how many such powers of the soul there are The question he does regard as meaningful is whether a power is distinguished solely in terms of its function or also in terms of its substrate as he puts it whether it differs from the other powers in subject as well as in intention ma n or only in intention LongAnima III ParaAnima Each of the five external senses for instance has its own subject a sensory organ whereas some of the higher sensory operations have dedicated organs in the brain whereas other operations such as recollection Black and choice Phillipson are mere functions produced by multiple powers working in conjunction This question of subject is particularly vexed as we will see for the powers of intellect The foundation of cognition at all levels is its passivity LongAnima II This is particularly clear for the five external senses which have as their objects the material qualities of the external world Color for instance the proper object of sight is an elemental mixture on the surface of bodies ParaParv I which acts on an illuminated medium and then the organ of the eye making its recipient at each stage be like the color itself The general although not perfect reliability of the process that a sense with respect to its proper sense object does not err in regard to it for the most part LongAnima II is a product of the natural world s causal regularity Indeed the passivity of the five senses is such that Ibn Rushd when speaking most carefully seems to treat these organs as themselves simply the corporeal media through which sensible qualities are conveyed to the one true principle of sensation the common sense al iss al mushtarak He writes for instance that through the innermost of all the curtains of the eye the common sense can perceive the form ParaParv I here is where we pass from a purely corporeal stage to the first of the spiritual stages ParaParv II The lesson he draws from Aristotle s notoriously obscure treatment of common sense De anima b ff is that the principle of sensation is one in number and multiple in extremities and organs like a point at the center of a circle ParaAnima Only here is perception both self aware and capable of assimilating the objects of multiple sensory modalities All subsequent cognition is dependent on the information collected at this stage See Black for the theory s strict empiricism To account for the functional role of common sense Ibn Rushd accepts its traditional even antiquated location at the heart with the concession that common sense has its origin there but terminates in the brain ParaParv II This brings sensible forms to the higher sensory powers of which he recognizes three that are distinct within the human brain both in function and in subject These faculties listed in order from the anterior to the posterior of the brain s supposed three chambers ParaParv II account for much of human cognition Most basically for details see LongAnima II III Blaustein Hansberger imagination allows us to form sensory images taken from sensation even when we are not presently sensing an object The cogitative power refines these images so as to allow a distinct grasp of the individual contents al ma n al shakh iya known in the Latin tradition as intentions that are confusedly contained within sensory experience Memory stores and recalls these images Ibn Rushd explicitly argues Incoherence II that the cogitative power can do all the work that Ibn S n had split between a cogitative power and a further estimative power al quwwa al wahmiyya The overall process is compared to the gradual abstracting and cleansing of the rind eventually leaving just the fruit itself ParaParv II these fruits being the substantial differences between individuals LongAnima II Nonhuman animals because they lack a cogitative power entirely are incapable of moving beyond superficial sensory appearances LongAnima III In keeping with his broadly naturalistic orientation Ibn Rushd allows the brain a much larger share of the cognitive load than one finds in most premodern philosophers But the fruit these corporeal powers yield is always a representation of a particular individual To think abstractly to have universal concepts requires the powers of intellect and here is where his naturalism notoriously comes to an end Ibn Rushd though he deploys a bewildering variety of terms for different aspects of intellect ultimately endorses just two intellectual powers distinct both in function and subject Following what was then the dominant Aristotelian view he treats the agent intellect as a single separate eternal substance and spends little time arguing for this doctrine or even explaining how it illuminates imagined intentions LongAnima III Davidson pp In contrast he discusses the material intellect at length in various treatises with his views evolving dramatically over time see Taylor Here we focus only on his final considered view of the subject as set out in the Long Commentary according to which the material intellect like the agent intellect is a single separate eternal substance LongAnima III Ibn Rushd recognized the audacity of supposing that human beings share in a single intellect writing that this claim came to me after long reflection and intense care and I have not seen it in anyone else before me CommAlex p Indeed he himself had once called such a view repulsive ParaAnima Still we can understand why he was eventually drawn to it in light of his commitment to three propositions Although the trio is jointly contradictory each claim is individually plausible A seems obvious B follows from the familiar Aristotelian argument that a power capable of understanding all bodies must itself contain the nature of no body LongAnima III C is a consequence of Ibn Rushd s eventual conclusion that the various strategies for situating an immaterial power within a human being his own and that of earlier commentators were all failures The genius of his ultimate position was to find a way for all three claims to be embraced In one sense human beings are individual composites of matter and substantial form and so wholly corporeal Although he consistently describes both the material and the agent intellect as parts of the human soul e g LongAnima III they are souls and actualities only equivocally they are not the actuality of a body LongAnima II II III When human beings are conceived in this narrow way C is true and A is false But of course there must be some sense in which A is true Ibn Rushd insists that even though we all share the material intellect its thinking can count as my thinking To explain this he appeals to Aristotle s doctrine that the soul never thinks without an image De anima III a Wirmer The material intellect although separate is dependent both for its function and for its very existence on receiving imagined intentions from individual human beings CommAlex p it is eternal only because the human species is eternal LongAnima III Each of us therefore partially controls the operation of this separate material intellect Its operation is to think but inasmuch as we each control our imagination and the imagination is what triggers thought it is appropriate to think of the thoughts we trigger as our thoughts and to think of the two shared intellects agent and material as each a part of our soul LongAnima II III III With this Ibn Rushd offers the first developed statement of the extended mind thesis that a being s cognitive system extends beyond the individual organism When human beings are conceived in this extended way A is true and C is false Even if this extended conception of a human being is allowed that still leaves a question about why these two separated intellects must each be singular and so shared by all human beings Ibn Rushd s answer depends in part on an argument against private concepts that without concepts that are literally shared teachers could not convey knowledge to students LongAnima III Ogden He also argues that an intellect individuated by a corporeal subject would receive individualized forms LongAnima III Ogden Accordingly he thinks the domain of actually intelligible concepts and of the intellects in which those objects exist must be entirely separate from the material realm and cannot be individuated by matter And as we have seen in the previous two sections he is for independent reasons committed to the existence of such a realm among the celestial spheres Accordingly the human intellectual powers can be identified as the lowest members of this hierarchy LongAnima III Davidson Taylor For further information see the entry on Arabic and Islamic psychology and philosophy of mind Ibn Rushd believes that God s existence can be demonstrated through a complex argument from Aristotelian physics establishing the existence of a first cause see As with physical arguments in general the argument is a mere sign dal l starting from empirical features of the world that are better known to us even if causally posterior LongMeta see He rejects the a priori metaphysical arguments of Ibn S n Davidson ch Bertolacci and of the Ash arite theologians Kashf all of which he thinks not only fall short of being demonstrative but also fail to be persuasive to ordinary people For them one should follow the example of the Qur n and deploy arguments from design Kashf In keeping with Aristotle s remarks in Metaphysics XII Ibn Rushd suggests that God serves not as an efficient cause but only as a final and formal cause Efficient causality prevails among natural bodies when one actually moving body brings another body from potential to actual motion The heavenly bodies however are already actual and eternally so and so in this domain efficient causation has no place PossibConj The relationship of First Cause to the celestial spheres then is that of intelligible to intellect that is the eternal thoughts of the First Cause are the forms that serve as final causes inspiring the celestial intelligences LongMeta XII XII LongCaelo IV Incoherence I Conjunction Epistle par God being wholly immaterial cannot directly act on the sublunary material realm at all but plays a causal role only through the mediation of the celestial spheres the temporal cannot proceed from an absolutely eternal being but only from an eternal being which is eternal in its substance but temporal in its movements namely the celestial body Incoherence I Interpretation here is more contentious than this brief summary suggests For various approaches see Kogan ch Davidson Adamson Twetten forthcoming God alone among intellectual beings has no further object of intellectual contemplation that might serve as his final cause On the contrary the First Form thinks of nothing outside itself LongAnima III EpiAnima EpiMeta LongMeta XII This helps account for God s unique simplicity as a pure mind always fully actualized by nothing other than God It leads to questions however about the sense in which God can be said to have knowledge of the created world This is the most powerful doubt regarding this conception of God EpiMeta and it threatens to lead to the view al Ghaz l had branded as heretical that God does not know particulars Incoherence II Ibn Rushd denies that he is committed to this consequence God has knowledge of the created world in his own manner neither in universal nor particular not as if his thoughts are caused by the world but rather as the cause of the world Incoherence I I am ma LongMeta XII The divine mind s thinking its own self is identical with its thinking all existence Incoherence I For terms to apply to God and creatures in a non univocal way bi ishtir k is a common state of affairs for Ibn Rushd LongMeta XII It arises for instance not just in the case of knowledge but also in the case of will For since God is exempt from passivity and change He does not exercise will in the usual sense of the term Incoherence I Still in another sense God is an intending and willing agent Kashf in virtue of the special causal relationship that God has to the world Similarly Ibn Rushd affirms in a special sense that God is the creator of the world QPhys Kashf and that God exercises providence in ya over all existent beings though he denies that any individual enjoys a special divine providence LongMeta XII XII EpiMeta It is difficult to assess the degree to which on this account either God s will or the world is necessitated Belo Hourani Taylor The various strands of Ibn Rushd s conception of God are set out on one hand against Ibn S n s insufficiently Aristotelian philosophy and on the other hand against Ash arite theology kal m His systematic examination of the Ash arites in al Kashf establishes at length that their methods are sophistical and delusional drawing on two basic resources the intention of Islamic law and Aristotle s philosophy Arfa Mensia But even where Ibn Rushd is examining the mutakallim n and offering rival interpretations of religious texts it is not his intention to set philosophy at the service of any kind of theology Instead these writings are more appropriately classified as philosophical considerations on religious texts and theological issues Prophecy is a good example of how Ibn Rushd distinguishes himself both from the theologians and from previous philosophical approaches Taylor The trustworthiness of prophecy is foundational to Islam the sending forth of prophets is based on the fact that revelation comes down to them from heaven and on this our religion is based Kashf The Ash arites had relied primarily on miracles to establish the veracity of the Prophet Muhammed Ibn Rushd evaluates this approach from his Aristotelian background His first step is to situate the miraculous mu jiz as a tool of persuasion belonging to the art of rhetoric standing to the prophetic claim as an extrinsic argument Ben Ahmed Analogously when I swear that something is true the oath I advance has no intrinsic connection to what is claimed as being true The Ash arites conceive of the relation between being prophetic and a miracle as that of a quality to its act The miracle must be in principle an act that is generated from that quality just as the act of healing the sick emanates from the quality of being a physician Kashf Accordingly the proof that I am a prophet is that I can produce an extra ordinary act such as walking on water turning a stick into a snake or splitting the moon Ibn Rushd responds by identifying a miracle as merely an external sign of prophecy The act that more closely demonstrates prophecy is to establish a law that is useful for people Thus it is the Qur n that proves Muhammad s veracity Because of the universality of the teaching of the Precious Book and the universality of the laws contained in it by which I mean their liability to promote the happiness of all mankind this religion is common to all mankind Kashf A miracle alone in contrast is at best complementary and an argument from miracles is merely persuasive or rhetorical See further Arfa Mensia Ben Ahmed The Decisive Treatise argues forcefully that philosophy should have a prominent place in religious reflection and specifically in Islamic law shar a This stance alongside his devotion to Aristotelian demonstration see might raise the question of Ibn Rushd s rationalism Does he regard philosophy as having some kind of priority in religious contexts But this question is not Ibn Rushd s inasmuch as he establishes no hierarchy between philosophy and true religion The law can serve as a kind of preamble to philosophy addressed to a much wider audience and containing clues to guide the philosopher in theoretical matters But there is no question of priority As he famously writes in a passage that perhaps tellingly echoes Aristotle s Prior Analytics I Since the law is true we the Muslim community know firmly that demonstrative reasoning does not lead to disagreement with what the law sets down For truth does not oppose truth but rather agrees with and bears witness to it Decisive Treatise see Taylor The implicit target of the Decisive Treatise is al Ghaz l s notorious fatwa against metaphysics By characterizing philosophy in narrowly metaphysical terms as a science that leads from artifacts back to the Artisan through demonstrative methods Ibn Rushd means to show that God cannot be demonstrably known without these methods To prohibit this path to knowledge from those who are capable of it is an injustice both to God and to these scholars In his Long Commentary on the Metaphysics I he goes so far as to distinguish between two types of shar a one general for everyone or most people and the other specific to the philosophers This might suggest that philosophy for those capable of it transcends the teachings of Islamic law Taylor but it is not at all clear that Ibn Rushd ever commits himself to such a claim Here in LongMeta he may be speaking of shar a only loosely as a way or method And even if he does mean that philosophy is literally a shar a it does not follow that it is a law that competes against religion After all the specific stands to the general as something that is complementary not conflicting To be sure the general shar a of Islam is partially subject to the interpretation of philosophers since they are the only ones who have the arsenal namely demonstration to bring out its hidden meanings allegories signs and symbols In the end however this serves shar a itself and cannot do otherwise since as Ibn Rushd never tires of declaring Islamic Law is true and it calls on everyone including philosophers to follow its prescriptions e g Incoherence II Decisive Treatise Philosophers pursue one path to this truth the most exalted path available to human beings but there are other paths such as the rhetorical and dialectical that also arrive at this truth For all of Ibn Rushd s involvement in esoteric questions of Aristotelianism he was at the same time a practicing judge deeply concerned with jurisprudential theory Ibn Rushd s principal work in this domain is the Distinguished Jurist s Primer a lengthy handbook on the causes of the jurists disputes and a comparison between the rationales for decision making by different Sunni schools of jurisprudence Its originality lies in the rational mechanisms that Ibn Rushd employs to establish general rules for understanding agreements and disagreements among jurists He writes that our intention in these matters is only the rules governing the law not an enumeration of the branches which would have no end Jurist s Primer ii So rather than focus on counting the differences that exist between jurists and schools of jurisprudence Ibn Rushd attempts to explain these differences by referring them to their principles rules and the causes that regulate them By following the points of disagreement between the jurists and deducing the causes of this disagreement and then bringing them back to the general principles and rules equivalent to a general maxim rooted in his soul Jurist s Primer ii the assiduous jurist al mujtahid becomes capable of deciding about the unknown situations he will face What makes these general rules so important is the imitative and repetitive style of jurisprudence in Ibn Rushd s day which had been overwhelmed by a focus on individual cases and the endless branching of views Thus either the jurist works according to a rule that distinguishes similar cases from others or he works according to ordinary common sense to produce controversial answers This is what the writings of the Malikites suffered from in his time Ibn Rushd insists on establishing jurisprudential maxims that make understandable the disagreement among schools of jurisprudence and jurists and provide the diligent jurist with basic mechanism for making decisions regarding emerging problems and cases Writings in medicine occupy an important place in Ibn Rushd s career The practice of medicine was not his profession it is this part of medicine that I believe restrains me from being perfect in this art And that I haven t had much practice Kulliyy t VII Even so he left many interesting texts a Commentary on Ibn S n s Medical Poem his al Kulliyy t General Principles of Medicine and various writings and commentaries on Galen Indeed it has been suggested that near the end of Ibn Rushd s career he was forced to set aside his philosophical project of writing the long commentaries on Aristotle s texts and turn instead to Galen s text on medicine Al Alaw a The commentary on Ibn S n challenges the usual conception of a rivalry between the two great Islamic philosophers He says that he chose to comment on Ibn S n s Poem because it is better than many of the introductions written in medicine CommIbnS n Even so during the last decade of Ibn Rushd s life it is Galen who becomes one of his principal authorities Still Galen is often a target of criticism In al Kulliyy t for example a work that he repeatedly revised G tje the revisions often move in a direction that is increasingly critical of Galen Kulliyy t II II etc Medicine for Ibn Rushd is an art rather than a science concerned with practice rather than theory Chandelier According to the prologue of al Kulliyy t This definition is based on the famous division of the arts into what belongs to the sphere of necessity and what belongs to the sphere of possibility The art of medicine does not belong to the sphere where consequences follow actions necessarily as with arts like carpentry In medicine even if the physician acts based on scientific principles the intended end does not necessarily follow As he puts it Apparently we do not have any of the premises that bring us certainty in many of these pursuits But even so we must try insofar as we are able Kulliyy t II The practical dimension of medicine is similarly central to his commentary on Ibn S n which begins with Ibn S n s statement that Medicine is preserving health and curing disease and comments This is the definition of medicine and its completion would be to say that medicine is an art whose action is preserving health and curing disease based on science and experience CommIbnS n see also Kulliyy t prol As one may notice Ibn Rushd insists on acting in both texts The purpose of al Kulliyy t according to its prologue is to draw from the art of medicine However al Kulliyy t is not a book of medical generalities as some translations tend to suggest It is rather a book on the universals of medicine kulliyy t f al ibb as its title suggests that is on the foundations principles and basic rules that regulate medical theory and practice It thus provides the foundations us uqs t of the medical art Kulliyy t III In the same vein al Kulliyy t is far from being a textbook kunn sh it is rather written against the tradition of textbooks that prevailed in the art of medicine It is a defense of the art of syllogistic medicine against experiential medicine He says As for those who limit themselves to the method of the textbooks without knowing the universal method they will certainly make mistakes as do the doctors of our time As for limiting oneself to universal matters this may be possible if the doctor is very skilled Therefore one of the considered conditions of perfection in the arts is that the craftsman have the power to deduce what he needs to deduce Kulliyy t VII The status of experience in medicine is limited but not entirely excluded Once the universals of the art of medicine are acquired one needs the experience from which particular premises are acquired in order to be used in each particular case These premises cannot be written in a book because they are unlimited Kulliyy t VII Ibn Rushd makes an exception however in criticizing the manuals and textbooks on medical particulars for Ab Marw n Ibn Zuhr whose al Tays r can be trusted because the particulars it contains conform to the universal teachings of theoretical medicine Kulliyy t VII In sum al Kulliyy t is an attempt to advance medical practice from the level of the infinite particulars which cannot be assembled in a book to the level of the rules q n n and established principles dust r that govern them Kulliyy t III It is an attempt to upgrade medical discourse to the level of a science linking its premises and principles to the Aristotelian natural sciences Al Alaw a This holistic methodology is characteristic of how Ibn Rushd approached the arts and sciences of his time It shows his inclination to organize them in a way that protects them from chaos and elevates them to the level of scientific practice established on the basis of universal principles and foundations Particular cases since they are unlimited cannot be dealt with unless there are general laws that help us to deduce decisions about particulars on the basis of principles and foundations The sciences for Ibn Rushd fundamentally divide into the theoretical na ar ya which is aimed at knowledge ilm and the practical amal ya which is concerned with voluntary action Republic I LongPhys proem The chief practical science is politics which Ibn Rushd sees as dividing much like medicine into a more theoretical and a more practical part The first and more theoretical part examines voluntary actions in general their associated dispositions the virtues and vices and the relationships between these elements The second more practical part examines how these dispositions become established within souls and how they are perfected and impeded Republic I The first part is found in Aristotle s Nicomachean Ethics and the second part in his Politics Although Ibn Rushd composed a commentary on the first of these and although he knew the second was available in Arabic elsewhere he complains that it has not yet reached us on this peninsula ParaEthics X G Accordingly he chose to comment on Plato s Republic as an alternative source for the second part of political science Following the Nicomachean Ethics Ibn Rushd takes the goal of human life to be happiness Hourani For ordinary people the ultimate guide to happiness is the Qur n which exhibits miraculous wisdom in the rules it sets out to promote human flourishing see But the ultimate human happiness for those who are capable of it is to become perfect in the theoretical sciences LongPhys proem Such perfection arrives when human beings conjoin themselves to the separate Agent Intellect which is to say that they pass from a partial conception of intelligible objects to a conception of the Agent Intellect itself At this point a human being in some sense takes on an eternal existence PossibConj LongPhys proem and is made like unto God LongAnima III and even becomes one of the eternal incorporeal beings PossibConj This notion of conjunction itti l had a complex history among earlier Aristotelians and Ibn Rushd s views about what it involves and whether it is possible developed over time Davidson Black The texts here are complicated but suggest that he rejected al F r b s complaint that conjunction is nothing other than an old woman s tale PossibConj Epistle par and that he accepted it as in some sense the goal of human life one that would be achieved through contemplation with the assistance of prayer and the Qur n PossibConj A perfect conjoined grasp of the theoretical sciences carries with it necessarily the complete possession of the moral virtues One so possessed will be perfect both in intellectual understanding and in the activity proper to him LongAnima III If this sort of moral excellence is not much on display in those we see make the greatest claims to the possession of science this only testifies to the poverty of their achievements LongPhys proem The perfection Ibn Rushd describes however through conjunction with the Agent Intellect seems to entail something other than personal immortality For he expressly refuses against al Ghaz l to endorse bodily resurrection Incoherence II and yet he also insists that the human soul is individuated in virtue of its body So as he explicitly concludes if the soul does not die when the body dies or if there is anything of this kind within the soul then it must once it has left the bodies be one in number Incoherence I So although scholarship is not unanimous on this point it seems that Ibn Rushd whatever he might have thought about conjunction did not mean for the promise of the soul s immortality to extend to each of us as individuals Taylor Just as the theoretical part of medicine has as its aim the more practical business of preserving health and curing disease so too in the political sphere the first part has as its end the perfection of the second part This is to say that the goal of ethical inquiry is ultimately the governance of cities ParaEthics I F This instrumental conception of ethics looks strange from the perspective of later European philosophy but it is what Aristotle himself expressly affirms at Nicomachean Ethics I and it comports well with Ibn Rushd s orientation away from individual human beings as the ultimate locus of value in the universe From the start Ibn Rushd announces that the goal of his commentary on the Republic will be to strip away the parts that are merely dialectical so as to identify the claims that achieve the level of demonstrative science Republic I Accordingly he attends very selectively to the ten books that comprise Plato s Republic dispensing entirely with the first and tenth books and the first half of the second book and merging the rest into three books The first presents political science and reflects on the components of the virtuous city especially the guards The second considers virtuous governments and the qualities of the ruler of the virtuous city and the philosopher The third is devoted to non virtuous governments comparisons between them and the transition from one to another The Platonic text is subjected to two parallel frameworks The first is Aristotelian both in its overarching theoretical framework replacing the dialectical and dialogical character of the Platonic text with Aristotle s ethical and logical framework Butterworth and in its particular details as when Ibn Rushd emphasizes the role of logic rather than mathematics in the training of the guards and the ruler of the virtuous city Republic II The second is the contextualization of this text in the Islamic and Andalusian environment Ibn Rushd takes the Umayyad Almoravid and Almohad dynasties as examples of many of the issues he deals with in the text and harshly criticizes the current Almohad reign e g Republic III as well as the position of the philosopher at the time which he compares to being surrounded by ferocious monsters Republic II This critical attitude is particularly notable when he discusses how women sharing the same natures as men are suited to the same activities fit to serve as guardians philosophers and rulers Yet as things are these capacities are not fostered since women in these cities are not prepared with respect to any of the human virtues they frequently resemble plants Their being a burden upon the men in these cities is one of the causes of poverty Republic I It is clear that Ibn Rushd comments on the Republic only for lack of Aristotle s superior work At the end of his paraphrase on the Nicomachean Ethics he describes the shortcomings in Plato s treatise and criticizes Ibn B jja for having judged the Republic as the perfect treatise on the virtuous city What is less clear is exactly what Ibn Rushd s own textual sources were Did he deal directly with Plato s text with the assistance of Galen al F r b and Aristotle s Rhetoric Or was the Platonic text not in his hands which means that he was commenting on Galen s Compendium on Plato s Politics with the help of al F r b and Aristotle While the use of Aristotle s and al F r b s texts is clear the question of his access to Plato remains obscure Mahdi Our focus has been Ibn Rushd But in studying this subject one cannot help but notice the strange way in which modern scholarship has concerned itself more with the later reception of his ideas than around Ibn Rushd himself Here we briefly consider the reception of his thought in Muslim Jewish and Christian contexts Ibn Rushd is often described as a philosopher who failed to attract the attention of his first audience resulting in the death of his philosophy at the hands of its intended Islamic readers a state of affairs that is said to have continued until its revival in the ideological debates of the Arab Renaissance nah a K gelgen al J bir To be sure Ibn Rushd s influence in Muslim contexts cannot compare to the overwhelming influence of Ibn S n nor even to Ibn Rushd s own influence in Europe Still the commonly heard claim that he had no influence on Islamic thought is false First recent scholarship has shown that Ibn Rushd had successors Ben Shar fa identifies direct disciples of Ibn Rushd most of whom were faithful and some of whom continued his work in philosophy and related sciences Second after Ibn Rushd s death his works were hardly ignored by the leading scholars in Andalusia and Morocco Theologians mathematicians suf s historians physicians philosophers and literary figures used Ibn Rushd s works extensively In medicine and logic his influence on Ibn uml s has recently become apparent Ibn uml s Ben Ahmed c a His influence also extended to Ash arite theology as when Ab al ajj j Y suf al Mikl t quoted Ibn Rushd s epitome on the Metaphysics and the Incoherence of the Incoherence to refute the philosophers amd n The same can be said of certain Maghrebi mathematicians who benefited from the conceptual arsenal provided by Ibn Rushd s philosophical writings In this context one can cite the example of Ibn Hayd r al T dil who put forward the concept of the one al w hid as crystallized by Ibn Rushd Ibn Hayd r Ibn uml s al Mikl ti Ibn Am ra al Makhz m and Ibn Hayd r among others appropriate Ibn Rushd s philosophical analysis without naming him whereas Ibn Sab n on occasion uses Ibn Rushd s writings without name even while in other places he criticizes him by name thus complicating the task of identifying the texts used Some of these texts in particular in jurisprudence and religion were part of the curriculum in Andalusia until its fall Ben Shar fa Akasoy Ben Ahmed b Indeed in Muslim contexts some of Ibn Rushd s works have been in constant use from the latter s lifetime until today They formed part of the training of scholars such as al Shar f Ab Abd All h al Tilims n and Ibn Khald n as well as part of the curriculum of important teachers such as Ab Abd al L h al bil Ibn al Kha b iii Ibn Khald n This enduring relevance accounts for their presence in both Ibn Khald n s Muqaddima and al Shar f al Tilims n s commentary on al Kh naj s al Jumal see al Rouwayheb Ben Ahmed and Cherrad Third evidence has emerged that some of Ibn Rushd s books were transmitted east to Egypt and the Levant and used by philosophers and scholars there In addition to copies of the Kashf and the Incoherence found in Turkey Egypt and India and the testimony of Maimonides who from Egypt was able to acquire most of Ibn Rushd s commentaries Davidson we can identify the spread of Ibn Rushd s ideas among some philosophers as is the case with the theory of the unity of truth adopted by Abd al Lat f al Baghd d Ben Ahmed a Moreover some of Ibn Rushd s philosophical and metaphysical positions concerning causality and location were adopted by thinkers who were generally regarded as enemies of philosophical and rational thought as is the case with Ibn Taymiyya who made extensive and explicit use of Ibn Rushd s texts and adopted some of his positions in his crystallization of his conception of the history of philosophy and kal m Ben Ahmed b b d Hoover Fourth we now also have evidence that Ibn Rushd s texts reached Iran in the sixteenth century and became widely known to scholars in the seventeenth century The catalogues indicate that dozens of them were transcribed during this time The large number of copies reflects another phenomenon that we should not continue to ignore the demand for the teaching of these books and their use by students and teachers in madrasas in Safavid Iran Some thinkers and philosophers used them in their debates and teaching Suffice it to mention here Abd al Razz q al L h j Mullah Rajab Al Tabr z and Mu ammad hir Wa d al Zam n Qazw n Endress Pourjavady and Schmidtke Ben Ahmed Ibn Rushd s philosophy quickly found a second home in Judaism where it became so prominent as even to supplant Aristotle as the paramount authority in philosophy and science Harvey The first and critical event was Maimonides acquisition of Ibn Rushd s commentaries perhaps around His subsequent praise of this work precipitated a four century fascination with Ibn Rushd among Jewish philosophers Harvey especially focusing on his commentaries but even extending to some of his religious treatises As Jewish authors began to write increasingly in Hebrew Ibn Rushd s texts followed thanks to a series of Arabic to Hebrew translations from onward see Zonta and in more detail Tamani and Zonta By virtually all of the commentaries were available in Hebrew even while very little of Aristotle himself was translated In parallel with this process Jewish authors began to write commentaries on Ibn Rushd giving rise to a extensive series of supercommentaries Glasner The leading example of this phenomenon is Gersonides series of supercommentaries on Ibn Rushd in the s Glasner The extent to which Ibn Rushd took precedence over other sources of Aristotelianism is quite startling A typical example is Shem Tov Ibn Falaquera whose introduction to his thirteenth century encyclopedia clarifies that all that I write are the words of Aristotle as explained in the commentaries of the scholar Averroes for he was the last of the commentators and he incorporated what was best from the earlier commentaries in Shem Tov Ibn Falaquera Each of the various types of Rushdian commentary had their champions at different times Here is the advice of Moses Almosnino from the sixteenth century do not squander your time with the epitomes and middle commentaries of Averroes but read only the long commentaries for if you read the long commentaries carefully you will have no need to read any other book in order to understand anything of natural science in Harvey Other important figures from the thirteenth century are Isaac Albalag and Isaac Polqar Prominent fourteenth century figures are Gersonides and Moses Narboni see Hayoun whose commentary on Ibn Rushd s theory of conjunction has been translated into English along with Ibn Rushd s epistle Prominent names from the fifteenth century include Abraham Bibago and Elijah Del Medigo see Hayoun Sixteenth century figures such Abraham de Balmes attempt more accurate Latin translations of Ibn Rushd drawing on earlier Arabic to Hebrew translations Ivry Hasse See also the entries on the influence of Arabic and Islamic Philosophy on Judaic thought and the influence of Islamic thought on Maimonides Ibn Rushd s influence on Christian Europe from the early thirteenth century through the Renaissance was massive and has been extensively studied Translations from Arabic into Latin began with Michael Scott around and by the middle of the century most of the Aristotelian commentaries had been translated Burnett Hasse Almost immediately after the work of translation began his ideas grew in influence Gauthier and already by the s he is known as the Commentator Concerns quickly arose however over certain contentious claims and by the s the term Averroist was used in a pejorative sense particularly with regard to the unicity of the intellect Kuksewicz see above the eternity of the world Dales see and the threat of determinism Martin see Even usually temperate authors such as Thomas Aquinas roused themselves to heated invective in considering these doctrines and in and again in lists of condemned propositions were directed at the arts faculty at the University of Paris many concerning views associated with Ibn Rushd Brenet Wippel The situation was however more complex than a simple opposition between the Averroists and their opponents At a minimum the field divides into three groups First are those whose enthusiasm for a Rushdian reading of Aristotle leads them take boldly heterodox views in tension with Christianity Leading figures here are Siger of Brabant Boethius of Dacia and John of Jandun Brenet Even in this case there are doubts however regarding whether Ibn Rushd is the prime impetus behind their views Van Steenberghen prefers the label radical Aristotelianism Second are those at the opposite extreme opposing not only Ibn Rushd s most radical ideas but even Aristotelianism itself as when Peter John Olivi complains of Aristotle that without reason he is believed as the god of this age Peter John Olivi Bonaventure becomes a leading figure in this movement Mahoney Third are the great majority of philosophers in between including Thomas Aquinas and other leading figures of the age who reject Ibn Rushd s readings of Aristotle when they conflict with Church authority even while in most matters they continue to rely on the Commentator Thus a papal decree from calls on the arts faculty at Paris to follow the science of Aristotle and his commentator Averroes and other ancient commentators and interpreters of Aristotle except in cases that run counter to the faith in Putallaz Where that third group agrees most fundamentally with Ibn Rushd is in the conviction that the way forward in philosophy at least in general is to adhere faithfully to the mind of Aristotle above Here Ibn Rushd looms particularly large over the history of European philosophy all the way through the Renaissance Akasoy and Giglioni Hasse During these later years his name continues to be divisive large numbers of theologians make common cause with the new breed of humanists against a persistent line of Averroists who continue to defend even Ibn Rushd s most notorious doctrines The most controversial figures are now Italian and often associated with the University of Padua such as Paul of Venice Pietro Pomponazzi Agostino Nifo and Giacomo Zabarella Yet even while fierce debate endures over the unity of the intellect and other such causes c l bres the general run of scholars and students continues page by page to rely on Ibn Rushd as the paramount guide to Aristotle New editions new supercommentaries and even whole new translations appear until nearly the end of the sixteenth century most famously the Junta editions of Aristotle with Ibn Rushd s commentaries from and again which remain in use to this day Where Ibn Rushd s influence is perhaps even more important but less easy to pin down concerns the relationship between philosophy and religion Klima Marenbon Normore The most distinctive feature of the Averroists is their inclination to pursue philosophical arguments to their logical conclusion regardless of Church doctrine To be sure this has close affinities with Ibn Rushd s insistence that philosophy should inform religious study see but in the censorious context of premodern Christianity such an approach was especially perilous Figures like Siger of Brabant would stake out boldly heterodox looking claims only to backtrack and insist that they were merely describing what pure philosophical reason would show not defending these views as true Often they would later disavow even their earlier strictly philosophical claims The autonomy of reason against the claims of religion was not a principle that could be easily defended at this time For further information

At Beijing s Robot Mall in Yizhuang the world s first S store for humanoid smart robots a figure named Li Bai takes center stage Dressed in traditional robes this humanoid is modeled after the renowned Tang Dynasty poet Its lifelike features from the delicately textured hair to the subtle wrinkles that move with speech bring the ancient literary icon vividly to life The robot was developed by EX Robots a tech company based in Dalian Northeast China s Liaoning province Our goal is to create machines that closely resemble humans seamlessly integrating into daily life as true companions said Li Boyang co founder and CEO of EX Robots Li s journey into robotics began in when he went to Japan to study smart algorithms at Waseda University It was there that he first encountered humanoid robots Seeing science fiction come to life inspired him to return to China in and build his own cyber world While many companies prioritize bipedal movement Li chose to concentrate on developing the upper body the core of human expression and interaction Most human abilities are in the upper body gestures facial expressions and emotional cues not just walking he explained That s why his research focuses on refining hand dexterity sensory perception facial micro expressions and emotional communication Unlike industrial robots with bulky mechanical arms Li s designs are highly precise allowing robots to mimic human hand movements and perform everyday tasks like typing or using scissors Small desktop robots typically have only four or five movable joints but our robots feature around joints each controlled by a sophisticated system Li noted Because of the high cost and complexity EX Robots has not yet made these creations available to individual consumers To bring these innovations closer to the public Li s team established the EX Future Science and Technology Museum in several cities across China These spaces showcase the latest robots and include semi open research centers where tech enthusiasts can experience cutting edge technologies not yet on the market The robots are also displayed at major events For example at this year s Shanghai Cooperation Organization Tianjin Summit XiaoQi a robot developed by EX Robots served as a guide offering multilingual assistance to both local and international media With her short stylish hair and sleek futuristic mech suit XiaoQi quickly became one of the standout figures of the company XiaoQi regularly appears at exhibitions said Liu Shihua brand manager at EX Robots She continues to learn and adapt in complex environments improving her ability to communicate naturally and seamlessly XiaoQi has also shown remarkable potential in elderly care At an event last October focused on seniors she not only demonstrated her ability to issue emergency alerts and remind elderly people to take their medication but also provided emotional companionship XiaoQi has memory which allows her to recall past conversations and interact with the elderly like a friend explained Zheng Yaxin EX Robots marketing head Liu recalled a moment at the st China Shenzhen International Cultural Industries Fair in May when a visitor believed that the robot Li Bai was a real person He spoke to the robot and even touched its skin only to realize it was a machine Liu said with a smile But EX Robots aims to give its creations more than lifelike appearances they strive to give them a soul Zheng remembers showcasing a robot named Wang Shuhe inspired by the Jin Dynasty medical expert at an exhibition The robot s diagnostic skills drew a crowd eager for medical advice Wang Shuhe doesn t respond in a stiff mechanical way Zheng said Instead it offers medical explanations in a humorous and approachable manner Just like humans each of our robots has its own unique personality and thoughts Li added This feature is now being integrated into EX Robots smart classrooms where figures like Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton personally share their knowledge with students The experience goes even further When students interact with the robotic Su Shi the renowned Song Dynasty poet they don t just learn about his poetry but also the works of his scholarly peers as well as the customs and political systems of his time By engaging in direct dialogue with these real historical figures students gain a deeper more dynamic understanding of the subjects they study Li said Reimagining robot roles As artificial intelligence continues to advance more young people are entering the growing field of robotics Yet Li has taken a calm reflective approach What makes robots truly valuable he asked Many people think robots should handle chores like cooking or doing laundry but I don t see that as a real need He believes such tasks are better suited for specialized machines while the true potential of humanoid robots lies in emotional communication and complex decision making Robots can become household assistants interacting with smart devices and more importantly engaging in emotional exchanges he said The ideal relationship between humans and robots is one of collaboration respect and shared growth Zheng

Frequentis is one of the world s leading providers for safety critical solutions in the field of Air Traffic Management and Public Safety Transport With over employees world wide it provides innovative user centered solutions to its customers Frequentis has been using Python in its TAPtools product family which focuses on the Tower and Airport Tools segment of Air Traffic Control These tools are used by air traffic controllers to track weather conditions control runway lighting and to monitor and control navigational aid instruments TAPtools products display runway and weather conditions for air traffic controllers managing the approach of incoming aircraft Zoom in One of the problems in developing air traffic control solutions is that each customer s unique airport regulatory picture and methodologies impose specific and different requirements for user interface look and behavior A significant part of the deployment of an air traffic control system is the customization of its interface Instead of developing each user interface from the ground up on a per customer basis Frequentis has developed a user interface layout tool called PanView similar to products like QDesigner or Visual Studio This tool is used to design and build the user interface which is then executed by a piece of software called the PanMachine The PanMachine runs on in house developed hardware called the PowerPanel a MHz PowerPC with MB RAM and a touch screen entry device TAPtools user interfaces are developed for the unique requirements of each air traffic control customer Zoom in With these tools Frequentis developers can rapidly prototype a layout in front of the customer greatly reducing the number of customer design workshops necessary in the deployment of a solution PanView and the PanMachine were originally developed using Lua as the scripting language used to connect the user interface to the underlying functionality of the air traffic control system This choice was found to be problematic for the layout implementors for a variety of reasons In a very important project the Finnish Civil Aviation Administration FCAA wanted to run their user interface layouts not just on the PowerPanel but also in the context of a web browser This requirement was important enough that it led to re implementation of the PanMachine in Java so it could be run as an applet in the browser Because Lua could not be run under Java this was a good time to replace it Python and Jython the Java implementation of Python were chosen because they would allow both the PowerPC and Java implementations of the PanMachine to execute the same user interface layouts Python implemented in C was used on the PowerPC and Jython implemented in Java was used in the browser applet Re implementation using Python went smoothly The Python language interpreter and support libraries are written in C and can be compiled with most C compilers In this project the ability for Python to be embedded into other code worked very well The documentation is excellent and the examples are easy to follow However the PowerPanel hardware has no hard disk and thus could not itself compile the Python interpreter s C sources To work around this problem the developers cross compiled Python from another machine producing object code for the PowerPC using a compiler running on another type of hardware Once this was done Python byte code produced on any machine could be run on the PowerPanel without modification only the initial compilation of the language itself required cross compilation Once the Python based implementation of the GUI layout tools was complete it became necessary to rewrite the existing Lua layouts using Python Our layout coders embraced Python with open arms because it solved all the problems they had been having with Lua and it made new code easier to write because of Python s straightforward syntax and extensive standard libraries In this transition we found that Python s syntax was very easy to learn for new users and our coders were able to completely rewrite the Lua layouts to take advantage of the new features offered by Python rather than just porting them at the language level The finished layout code contains about lines which is half the size of the original code is much easier to maintain and works flawlessly with Jython in the Java port of the PanMachine Python enabled us to fulfill customer requirements in a time critical project while improving the overall quality of our tools Since changing to Python layout implementation has become much easier for a variety of reasons Since using Python in our development the time to write new user interface layouts for the TAPtools product family has been reduced by a factor three Michael Bartl initially joined Frequentis in as a software engineer to test telecommunication hardware and later moved on to develop weather information systems After several years he is now Product Manager for the TAPtools product family His main addictions are Java Python and Chess
WASHINGTON Nov Xinhua At a m GMT on Wednesday the U S federal government shutdown entered its th day surpassing the previous day record set during the shutdown making it the longest government shutdown in U S history At midday on Tuesday the U S Senate made its th attempt to advance a short term funding bill proposed by Republicans and already passed by the House but the procedural vote fell short of the votes required for approval As has been the case throughout the more than month long government shutdown leaders of both the Republican and Democratic parties continued to trade blame on Tuesday with no signs of negotiation or compromise Republicans refuse to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits which is going to result in tens of millions of Americans experiencing dramatically increased premiums co pays and deductibles House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries the top Democrat in the lower chamber warned at a press conference U S House Speaker Mike Johnson the top Republican in the chamber meanwhile said at a separate press conference that the Schumer shutdown was never about health care or any other policy referring to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer Right now the Democrats fear political retribution from far left activists in their party more than they fear the consequences of keeping the government closed for weeks on end said Johnson As the two parties remained locked in a war of words the impact of the record breaking shutdown continued to spread dealing a heavy blow to multiple areas affecting people s daily lives including aviation safety and food assistance programs Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned on Tuesday that the ongoing government shutdown has increased risks to air travel cautioning that widespread flight cancellations and even potential airspace closures could occur if air traffic controllers go without a second full paycheck next week Data from the U S flight tracking website FlightAware shows that thousands of flights across the country are experiencing delays every day A widely watched food assistance program has also been impacted After interventions by two federal judges U S President Donald Trump s administration announced on Monday that it would use emergency funds to maintain half of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits for this month Some states may take weeks or even months to resume full distributions On Tuesday however Trump wrote on social media that relief funds would only be distributed once the government reopens The program covers million Americans roughly one eighth of the national population most of whom live below the poverty line Democrats have accused Trump of weaponizing hunger In addition more than million federal employees have gone without pay with some forced to line up for free food assistance potentially leading to reduced consumer spending The delay in releasing key economic data has also heightened uncertainty Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently said it remains unclear whether the ongoing government shutdown and the resulting lack of crucial economic data will affect the Fed s December policy decision What do you do if you re driving in a fog You slow down Powell said The U S Congressional Budget Office recently warned that depending on the duration of the shutdown the annualized growth rate of U S real GDP in the fourth quarter could decline by to percentage points If the shutdown lasts six weeks economic losses would rise to billion U S dollars if it continues for eight weeks losses would reach billion dollars Public sentiment has fallen amid the government shutdown A recent Gallup poll showed that public approval of Congress has dropped to percent with nearly percent of U S adults disapproving of its performance According to a recent ABC News Washington Post Ipsos poll percent of Americans said the Democratic Party is out of touch with the concerns of most citizens while percent said the same about the Republican Party

Johannes Kepler is one of the most significant representatives of the so called Scientific Revolution of the th and th centuries Although he received only the basic training of a magister and was professionally oriented towards theology at the beginning of his career he rapidly became known for his mathematical skills and theoretical creativity As a convinced Copernican Kepler was able to defend the new system on different fronts against the old astronomers who still sustained the system of Ptolemy against the Aristotelian natural philosophers against the followers of the new mixed system of Tycho Brahe whom Kepler succeeded as Imperial Mathematician in Prague and even against the standard Copernican position according to which the new system was to be considered merely as a computational device and not necessarily a physical reality Kepler s complete corpus can be hardly summarized as a system of ideas like scholastic philosophy or the new Cartesian systems which arose in the second half of the th century Nevertheless it is possible to identify two main tendencies one linked to Platonism and giving priority to the role of geometry in the structure of the world the other connected with the Aristotelian tradition and accentuating the role of experience and causality in epistemology While he attained immortal fame in astronomy because of his three planetary laws Kepler also made fundamental contributions in the fields of optics and mathematics To the little known facts regarding Kepler s indefatigable scientific activity belong his efforts to develop different technical devices for instance a water pump which he tried to patent and apply in different practical contexts for the documents see KGW pp and To his contemporaries he was also a famous mathematician and astrologer for his own part he wanted to be considered a philosopher who investigated the innermost structure of the cosmos scientifically Johannes Kepler was born on December in Weil der Stadt a little town near Stuttgart in W rttemberg in southwestern Germany Unlike his father Heinrich who was a soldier and mercenary his mother Katharina was able to foster Kepler s intellectual interests He was educated in Swabia firstly at the schools Leonberg Adelberg and Maulbronn later thanks to support for a place in the famous T binger Stift at the University of T bingen Here Kepler became Magister Artium before he began his studies in the Theological Faculty At T bingen where he received a solid education in languages and in science he met Michael Maestlin who introduced him to the new world system of Copernicus see Mysterium Cosmographicum trans Duncan p and KGW VI pp Before concluding his theology studies at T bingen in March April Kepler accepted an offer to teach mathematics as the successor to Georg Stadius at the Protestant school in Graz in Styria Austria During this period he composed many official calendars and prognostications and published his first significant work the Mysterium Cosmographicum MC which catapulted him to fame overnight On April Kepler married his first wife Barbara M ller von M hleck As a consequence of the anti Protestant atmosphere in Graz and thanks also to the positive impact of his MC on the scientific community he abandoned Graz and moved to Prague in to work under the supervision of the great Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe His first contact with Tycho was however extremely traumatic particularly because of the Ursus affair see below Section After Tycho s unexpected death on October Kepler succeeded him as Imperial Mathematician During his time in Prague Kepler was particularly productive He completed his most important optical works Astronomiae pars optica APO and Dioptrice D published several treatises on astrology De fundamentis astrologiae certioribus Antwort auf Roeslini Diskurs Tertius interveniens discussed Galileo s telescopic discoveries Dissertatio cum nuncio sidereo and composed his most significant astronomical work the Astronomia nova AN which contains his first two laws of planetary motion On August Kepler s wife Barbara M ller died In he moved to Linz in Upper Austria and became a professor at the Landschaftsschule There he served as Mathematician of the Upper Austrian Estates from to In he married Susanne Reuttinger with whom he had six children In he completed the mathematical works Stereometria doliorum and Messekunst Archimedis At the end of Kepler successfully defended his mother who had been accused of witchcraft In he published his principal philosophical work the Harmonice mundi HM and wrote partially at the same time the Epitome astronomiae copernicanae EAC In Kepler continued his investigations on mathematics publishing his work on logarithms Chilias logarithmorum In pursuit of an accurate printer for the Tabulae Rudolphinae he moved to Ulm near the end of and remained there until the end of In July he went to Sagan to enter the service of Albrecht von Wallenstein He died on November at Regensburg where he was to present his financial claims before the imperial authorities for Kepler s life Caspar s biography is still the best work KGW contains biographically relevant documents For a brief overview of Kepler s ideas and achievements in a broadly biographical context see Osterhage There is probably no such thing as Kepler s philosophy in any pure form Nevertheless many attempts to deal with the philosophy of Kepler have been made all of which are very valuable in their own way Some studies have concentrated on a particular text see for instance Jardine for the Defense of Tycho against Ursus or have followed some particular ideas of Kepler over a longer period of his life and scientific career see for instance Martens on Kepler s theory of the archetypes Others have tried to determine from a philosophical point of view his place in the development of the astronomical revolution from the th to the th centuries Koyr and or in the more general context of the scientific movement of the th century Hall and especially Burtt Still others have discussed a long list of philosophical principles operating in Kepler s scientific world and have claimed to have found by means of such an analysis compelling evidence for the interaction between science philosophy and religion Kozhamthadam If in the particular case of Kepler philosophy is immediately related to astronomy mathematics and finally cosmology a notion which arises much later the core of these speculations is to be sought in the spectrum of problems with which he dealt in his Mysterium Cosmographicum and Harmonice Mundi on this topic Field is one of the most representative works on Kepler In addition because of the particular circumstances of his life and his fascinating personality and genius the literature on Kepler is extremely wide ranging covering a spectrum from literary pieces like Max Brod s Tycho Brahes Weg zu Gott though still not free from mistakes concerning Kepler to general introductions in the genre of historical novels and even fictional stories and charlatanry on astrology or running for some years now portraying him as the assassin of Tycho Brahe However according to recent reports it is still a matter of controversy whether Tycho was assassinated at all see the report at phys org Kepler mastered like the best scientists the most complicated technical issues especially in astronomy but he always emphasized his philosophical even theological approach to the questions he dealt with God manifests himself not only in the words of the Scriptures but also in the wonderful arrangement of the universe and in its conformity with the human intellect Thus astronomy represents for Kepler if done philosophically the best path to God see H bner Methuen and Jardine Kirby As Kepler at the core of his greatest astronomical work confesses AN Part II chap KGW p Engl trans p at the beginning of his career he was able to taste the sweetness of philosophy with no special interest whatsoever in astronomy And even in his later work after having calculated many ephemerides and different astronomical data Kepler writes in a letter of February to V Bianchi I also ask you my friends that you do not condemn me to the treadmill of mathematical calculations allow me time for philosophical speculation my only delight KGW let N p lin Especially where Kepler deals with the geometrical structure of the cosmos he always returns to his Platonic and Neoplatonic framework of thought Michalik J Rudenko and Lastovets Thus the polyhedral hypothesis see Section below he postulated for the first time in his MC represents a kind of formal cause constituting the foundational structure of the universe In addition an efficient cause which realizes this structure in the corporeal world is also needed This is of course God the Creator who accomplished His work according to the model of the five regular polyhedra Kepler reinterprets the traditional statements about the Creation as an image of the Creator giving to the ancient ideas a more systematic and a quantitative character Even the doctrine of the Trinity could be geometrically represented taking the center for the Father the spherical surface for the Son and the intermediate space which is mathematically expressed in the regularity of the relationship between the point and the surface for the Holy Spirit In Kepler s model we have to be able to reduce all appearances to straightness and curvature as providing the foundation for the geometrical structure of the world s creation The very first category through which God produced a fundamental similitude of the created World to Himself is that of quantity see MC chapter KGW pp Furthermore quantity was also introduced into the human soul for the specific purpose that this fundamental symmetry could be apprehended and known scientifically This kind of speculation also belongs to the basic principles of Kepler s philosophical optics In Chapter of APO On the Nature of Light Kepler gives a new account of this Trinitarian Cosmogony As he admits in a letter to Thomas Harriot his approach here is more theological than optical KGW let p lin Similar to his speculations in MC Kepler explains again the symmetry between God and the Creation but now he goes slightly beyond the limits of a theologico geometrical reflection Firstly he seems to assume that the bodies of the world were provided in the Creation with some powers which enable them to exceed their geometrical limits and to act on other bodies magnetic power is a good example of this Secondly the principle of symmetry introduced into matter constitutes the most excellent thing in the whole corporeal world the matrix of the animate faculties and the chain linking the corporeal and spiritual world APO Engl trans p Thirdly as expressed by Kepler in a wonderful long Latin sentence with multiple subordinations this principle has passed over into the same laws in leges easdem by which the world was to be furnished ibid p the original passage is in KGW p the marginal note in the edition is lucis encomium Finally these reflections are concluded with a remark in which as with Copernicus Marsilio Ficino and others the central position of the Sun is legitimated because of its function in spreading light and indirectly life Similar speculations are still present in EAC KGW pp and It is also worth noting that these speculations are of vital importance to the special way in which Kepler conceived of astrology see for instance De fundamentis astrologiae certioribus with Engl trans and commentary in Field Philosophical geometrical and even theological speculations related to the five regular polyhedra the cube or hexahedron the tetrahedron the octahedron the icosahedron and the dodecahedron were known at least from the time of the ancient Pythagoreans Since Plato s Timaeus these five geometrical solids played a leading role and for the later tradition they became known as the five Platonic solids Figure Table in Mysterium Cosmographicum with Kepler s model illustrating the intercalation of the five regular solids between the imaginary spheres of the planets cf KGW pp Plato establishes at the physical and chemical level a correspondence between them and the five elements earth water air fire and ether and tries to provide this correspondence with geometrical grounds A further source of historically decisive importance is the fact that the five regular polyhedra are treated in Euclid s Elements of Geometry a work that for Kepler especially in the Platonic approach of Proclus has a central position Claessens At the very beginning of HM Kepler complains about the fact that the modern philosophical and mathematical school of Peter Ramus had not been able to understand the architectonic structure of the Elements which are crowned with the treatment of the five regular polyhedra In addition a revival of Platonic philosophy was taking place in Kepler s time and inspired not only philosophers and mathematicians but also architects artists and illustrators see Field Amidst this general interest in the regular polyhedra during the Renaissance Kepler was specifically concerned with their application in the resolution of a cosmological problem namely the reality of the Copernican system see Section below To achieve this goal he introduced his polyhedral hypothesis already in MC where he looked for an a priori foundation of the Copernican system see Aiton Di Liscia The background for such an approach seems to be that the a posteriori way which according to Kepler was taken over by Copernicus himself cannot lead to a necessary affirmation of the reality of the new world system but only to a probable and hence to an instrumental representation of it as a computational device This is the Osiander or Wittenberg Interpretation of Copernicus which Kepler directly attacked not only in his MC but also later in his AN see Westman and In MC he claimed to have found an answer to the following three main questions the number of the planets the size of the orbits i e the distances the velocities of the planets in their orbits By referring to the polyhedral hypothesis see Figure Kepler found a definitive and simple answer to the first question By intercalating the polyhedra between the spheres which carry the planets one must inevitably finish with the sphere of Saturn surrounding the cube there are no more polyhedra to be intercalated and as remains the standard case for Renaissance and modern astronomy there are no more planets to be carried by the spheres It is absolutely decisive for the consistency of the argument that the necessity of the hypothesis is guaranteed by the fact that it already exists as a mathematical demonstration by Euclid Elements XIII prop schol according to which there are only five regular Platonic for the tradition polyhedra For the second and third questions the answer is of course not as evident as for the first one However Kepler was able to show that distances which are derived from the geometrical model of the five regular bodies fit much better with the Copernican system than with that of Ptolemy The answer to the third question needs in addition the introduction of a notion of power that emanates from the Sun and extends to the outer limit of the universe see Stephenson pp In HM Kepler continues his investigations of the polyhedra at a cosmological as well as a mathematical level In the second book dealing with congruence which here does not mean as it does today the same size and shape but the property of figures filling the surface together with other regular polygons on the plane or to build closed geometric solids hence in space Kepler made new mathematical discoveries working with tessellations He discovered two new solids the so called small and great stellated dodecahedrons The treatment of the regular polyhedra constitutes one of the two principal pillars of HM Book chapters where the third law is formulated see Caspar in KGW Nachbericht p and Engl trans p xxxiii Following his approach from MC and complementing it with occasional references to his EAC Kepler makes use again of the Platonic solids to determine the number of the planets and their distances from the Sun Meanwhile he has learned that the application of his old polyhedral hypothesis has limits As he tells us in a footnote in the second edition of his MC from he was earlier convinced of the possibility of explaining the eccentricities of the planetary orbits by values derived a priori from this hypothesis MC Engl trans p Now with access to the observational data of Tycho Kepler had to exclude this explanation and look for another And this is one of the most significant achievements of his basic harmonies which in turn are derived from the regular polygons constituting the second great pillar of Book Almost all of Kepler s scientific investigations reflect a philosophical background and many of his philosophical questions find their final answer even if they are of scientific interest in the realm of theology From a very modern point of view one could highlight Kepler s epistemological thought in terms of four different items realism causality his philosophy of mathematics and his own particular empiricism Realism is a constant and integral part of Kepler s thought and one which appears in sophisticated form from the outset The reason for this is that his realism always runs parallel to his defense of the Copernican worldview which appeared from his first public pronouncements and publications Many of Kepler s thoughts about epistemology can be found in his Defense of Tycho against Ursus or Contra Ursum CU a work which emerged from a polemical framework the plagiarism conflict between Nicolaus Raimarus Ursus and Tycho Brahe causality and physicalization of astronomical theories the concept and status of astronomical hypotheses the polemic realism instrumentalism his criticism of skepticism in general the epistemological role of history etc It is one of the most significant works ever written on this subject and is sometimes compared with Bacon s Novum organum and Descartes Discourse on Method Jardine p for an excellent new edition and complete study of this work see Jardine Segonds The focus of the epistemological issues could be ranked mutatis mutandi with modern discussion surrounding the scientific status of astronomical theories however as Jardine has pointed out it would be sounder to read Kepler s CU more as a work against skepticism than in the context of the modern realism instrumentalism polemic For Pierre Duhem for instance the position of Andreas Osiander which was adopted by Ursus and which was according to Duhem naively criticized by Kepler in his MC represents the modern approach known as instrumentalism According to this epistemological position held by Duhem himself scientific theories are not to be closely linked to the concepts of truth and falsehood Hypotheses and scientific laws are nothing more than instruments for describing and predicting phenomena seldom for explaining them The aim of physical theories is not to offer a causal explanation or to study the causes of phenomena but simply to represent them In the best case scenario theories are able to order and classify what is decisive for their predictive capacity Duhem Contrary to Tycho and Kepler Ursus held a fictionalist position in astronomy Yet in the very beginning of his work De hypothesibus Ursus makes a clear declaration about the nature of astronomical theories which is very similar to the approach suggested by Osiander in his forward to Copernicus De revolutionibus a hypothesis is a fictitious supposition introduced just for the sake of saving the motions of the heavenly bodies and to calculate them trans Jardine p Following his approach in MC and anticipating the opening pages of his later AN see particularly AN II Why and to what extent may a false hypothesis yield the truth Engl trans pp Kepler addresses the question of Copernicanism and its reception by thinkers such as Osiander who emphasized that the truth of astronomical hypotheses cannot necessarily be deduced from the correct prediction of astronomical facts According to this interpretation Copernican hypotheses are not necessarily true even if they are able to save the phenomena otherwise one would commit a fallacia affirmationis consequentis However according to Kepler this happens only by chance and not always but only when the error in the one proposition meets another proposition whether true or false appropriate for eliciting the truth trans Jardine p To be noted is that as Jardine p has pointed out the modern scientific realist departs from a real independent world while Kepler s notion of truth presupposes that neither nature nor the human mind are independent of God s mind Jardine p The reality of astronomical hypotheses and hence the superiority of the Copernican world system implied a physicalization of astronomical theories and in turn an accentuation of causality Despite Kepler s criticism of Aristotle this aspect can actually be considered the realization in the field of astronomy of the old Aristotelian ideal of knowledge knowledge means to grasp the causes of the phenomena Thus on the one hand causality is a notion implying the most general idea of actual scientific knowledge which guides and stimulates each investigation In this sense Kepler already embarked in his MC on a causal investigation by asking for the cause of the number the sizes and the motions the speeds of the heavenly spheres see Section above On the other hand causality implies in Kepler according to the Aristotelian conception of physical science the concrete physical cause the efficient cause which produces a motion or is responsible for keeping the body in motion Original to Kepler however and typical of his approach is the resoluteness with which he was convinced that the problem of equipollence of the astronomical hypotheses can be resolved and the consequent introduction of the concept of causality into astronomy traditionally a mathematical science This approach is already present in his MC where he for instance relates for the first time the distances of the planets to a power which emerges from the Sun and decreases in proportion to the distance of each planet up to the sphere of the fixed stars see Stephenson pp One of Kepler s decisive innovations in his MC is that he replaced the mean Sun of Copernicus with the real Sun which was no longer merely a geometrical point but a body capable of physically influencing the surrounding planets In addition in notes to the edition of MC Kepler strongly criticizes the notion of soul anima as a dynamical factor in planetary motion and proposes to substitute force vis for it see KGW p Engl trans p note One of the most important philosophical aspects of Kepler s Astronomia Nova from AN is its methodological approach and its causal foundation see Mittelstrass Kepler was sufficiently conscious of the change of perspective he was introducing into astronomy Hence he decided to announce this in the full title of the work Astronomia Nova Aitiologetos seu physica coelestis tradita commentariis de motibus stellae Martis Ex observationibus G V Tychonis Brahe New Astronomy Based upon Causes or Celestial Physics Treated by Means of Commentaries on the Motions of the Star Mars from the observations of Tycho Brahe trans Donahue In the introduction to AN Kepler insists on his radical change of view his work is about physics not pure kinematical or geometrical astronomy Physics as in the traditional Aristotelian understanding of the discipline deals with the causes of phenomena and for Kepler that constitutes his ultimate approach to deciding between rival hypotheses AN Engl trans p see Krafft On the other hand since his celestial physics uses not only geometrical axioms but also other non mathematical axioms the knowledge obtained often has a kernel of guesswork In the third part of AN chapters Kepler deals with the path of the Earth and intends to offer a physical account of the Copernican theory By so doing he includes the idea that a certain notion of power should be made responsible for the regulation of the differences in velocities of the planets which in turn have to be established in relation to the planets distances Now the Copernican planetary theory departs from the general principle that the Earth moves regularly on an eccentric circle For Kepler on the contrary the planets are moved irregularly and the slower they are moved the greater their distance is from the center of power the Sun Addressing the physical aspects of his new astronomy he deals in chapters perhaps the most idiosyncratic of the work with his notion of motive power Here he combines different approaches and sources sometimes producing for the purpose of simplifying the whole geometrical construction of geometrical astronomy by introducing a power causing motions a new confusion at the dynamical level To begin with it is not always absolutely clear what kind of power Kepler has in mind He inclines above all to the idea of a magnetic power residing in the Sun but he also mentions light and at least indirectly gravity which he does not bring into operation in the central chapters of the AN but which is to a certain extent implied in his explanations using the model of the balance and which he surely accepts as true for the Sun Moon system as he explains in the general introduction Secondly it is not always clear what this power is and how it acts especially when he is speaking merely analogically as if particularly in the case of light Essentially Kepler breaks down the motions of the planets into two components On the one hand the planets move around the Sun at this state of the discussion circularly On the other hand they exhibit a libration on the Sun planet vector The rotation of the Sun is responsible for the motion of the planets Irradiating from the rotating Sun is a power which spreads at the ecliptic plain This power diminishes with distance to the source of the power that is to the Sun A decisive work for Kepler s development in his physical astronomy is William Gilbert s De magnete London a work which also intends to offer a new physics for the new Copernican cosmology and which surely influenced Kepler s thoughts about this power One of the main problems was of course how to apply the general principles of magnetism to planetary motion first to explain the difference in velocity on a circular path and later to give an account of the motion on an ellipse Kepler conceives of a model with parallel magnetic fibers which links the Sun with the planets in such a way that the rotation of the Sun causes the motion of the planets around it The fibers are born in the planets parallel and perpendicular to the lines of apsides by a kind of animal power The planets themselves are polarized that is with one pole they are attracted to the Sun with the other pole they are pushed away from it This explains very well the direction of planetary motion the planets all move in one direction because the Sun rotates in that direction Nevertheless a further problem still seems to remain unresolved according to Kepler s explication the planets should move around the Sun as fast as the Sun itself rotates which is not the case This phenomenon can be explained by referring to a property of matter which for Kepler has an axiomatic character the inclinatio ad quietem that is the tendency to rest see especially AN chap KGW p As a consequence the planets are moved around the Sun slower than they would be if the power of the Sun were at work alone Kepler s causal approach is above all present in his Epitome a voluminous work which exercised a considerable influence on the later development of astronomy In the second part of Book he deals with the motion of the world s parts Not the two first laws but rather the third law which he had recently announced in his HM is Kepler s starting point for this law rather than a calculational device for the path of one planet represents a general cosmological statement and thus it is more convenient for his approach here At the same time it should be pointed out that the third law is not necessarily the best point of departure for a dynamical causal approach to motion as Kepler intends here for in comparison with the previous causal approaches the question of the location of the cause of power responsible for the production of motion remains relevant The spheres which in the traditional view transported the planets had been abolished since the time of Tycho Furthermore Kepler is clearly against the moving intelligences of the Aristotelian tradition The fact that the orbits are elliptical and not circular shows that the motions are not caused by a spiritual power but rather by a natural one which is internal to the composition of matter The planets themselves are provided with inertia a property as Kepler understood it that inhibits motion and represents an impediment to it The motive power vix motrix comes indeed from the Sun which sends its rays of light and power in all directions These rays are captured by the planets Kepler however tries to explain this behavior of the planets less through astrology and much more through magnetism a physical phenomenon which was by no means clearly understood in his time Firstly the Sun rotates and by so doing sets in motion the planets around it Secondly since the planets are poles of magnets and the Sun itself acts with magnetic power the planets are at different parts of their orbits either attracted or repelled in this way the elliptical path is causally produced Kepler partially gives up the mechanical approach by postulating a soul in the Sun which is responsible for its regular motion of rotation a motion on which finally the entire system depends In fact the planets are also supposed by Kepler to rotate and are therefore provided with a sort of soul or some such principle which produces the rotation In addition to astronomy and cosmology Kepler expanded his causal approach to include the fields of optics see Section below and harmonics Section below Beyond his own original talent it is clear that Kepler was trained in mathematics from his earliest studies at T bingen At least officially his positions at Graz Prague Linz Ulm and Sagan can be characterized as the typical professional occupations of a mathematician in the broadest sense i e including astrology and astronomy theoretical mechanics and pneumatics metrology and every topic that could in some way be related to mathematics Besides the field of astronomy and optics where mathematics is ordinarily applied in different ways Kepler produced original contributions to the theory of logarithms and above all within his favorite field geometry especially with his stereometrical investigations For the medieval proportions theory as a background for Kepler s logarithms see Rommevaux Tani Thus on account of his natural predilection and talent and the importance of mathematics particularly of geometry for his thought it is not surprising to find many different passages in his works where he articulated his philosophy of mathematics However Kepler s principal exposition on this topic is to be found in his HM a work in which the first two books are purely mathematical in content As he himself declares in HM he played the role not of a geometer in philosophy but of a philosopher in this part of geometry KGW p Engl trans p While in philosophical questions related to mathematics Proclus and Plato were Kepler s most important inspirational sources he did not always see Plato and Aristotle as completely opposed for the latter in Kepler s interpretation also accepted a certain existence of the mathematical entities KGW let N p see Peters p To a great extent Kepler understood his mathematical investigations of HM as a continuation of Euclid s Elements especially of the analysis of irrationalities in Book The central notion that he works out here is that of constructability According to Kepler each branch of knowledge must in principle be reducible to geometry if it is to be accepted as knowledge in the strong sense although in the case of the physics this condition is as the AN emphasizes only a necessary and not a sufficient condition Thus the new principles he was elaborating over the years in astrology were geometrical ones A similar case occurs with the basic notions of harmony which after Kepler could be reduced to geometry Of course not every geometrical statement is equally relevant and equally fundamental For Kepler the geometrical entities principles and propositions which are especially fundamental are those that can be constructed in the classical sense i e using only ruler without measurement units and compass On this are based further notions according to different degrees of knowability scibilitas which begins with the circle and its diameter Once again Kepler understood this within the framework of his cosmological and theological philosophy geometry and especially geometrically constructible entities have a higher meaning than other kinds of knowledge because God has used them to delineate and to create this perfect harmonic world From this point of view it is clear that Kepler defends a Platonist conception of mathematics that he cannot assume the Aristotelian theory of abstraction and that he is not able to accept algebra at least in the way he understood it So for instance there are figures that cannot be constructed geometrically although they are often assumed as safe geometrical knowledge The best example of this is perhaps the heptagon This figure cannot be described outside of the circle and in the circle its sides have of course a determinate magnitude but this is not knowable Kepler himself says that this is important because here he finds the explanation for why God did not use such figures to structure the world Consequently he devotes many pages to discussing the issue KGW Prop pp see also KGW p Certainly for a geometer like Kepler approximations constitute as mathematical theory a painful and precarious way to progress The philosophical background for his rejection of algebra seems to be at least partially Aristotelian in some of its basic suppositions geometrical quantities are continuous quantities which therefore cannot be treated with numbers that are in the inverse discrete quantities But the difference from the Aristotelian ideal of science remains an important one for Aristotle a crossover between arithmetic and geometry is allowed only in the case of the middle sciences while for Kepler all knowledge must be reduced to its geometrical foundations Recent research has tried to show that Kepler has followed the criteria of a Pythagorean methodology when studying the phenomena of light refraction This would be evident in Kepler s application of the principle of sameness is knowable by sameness and additionally in his tendency to avoid the infinite or rather to set limits to infinite magnitudes Cardona Su rez A general presentation of Kepler s philosophical attitude and principles is not complete without reference to his link to the world of experience For despite his mainly theoretical approach in the natural sciences Kepler often emphasized the significance of experience and in general of empirical data In his correspondence there are many remarks about the significance of observation and experience as for instance in a letter to Herwart von Hohenburg from KGW let N lines or from to Fabricius KGW let N p lines to mention only two of his most important correspondents Looking for empirical support for the Copernican system Kepler compares different astronomical tables in his MC and in AN he makes extensive use of Tycho s observational treasure trove In MC chapter he quotes a long passage from Rheticus for the sake of rhetorical support when as was the case here the data of the tables he used did not fit perfectly with the calculated values from the polyhedral hypothesis In this passage the reader learns that the great Copernicus whose world system Kepler defends in MC said one day to Rheticus that it made no sense to insist on absolute agreement with the data because these themselves were surely not perfect After all it is questionable whether Kepler using for instance the Prutenic Tables of Erasmus Reinhold had access to complete and correct empirical information to confirm the Copernican hypothesis in grand style as he claimed for an analysis of Reihold s tables and their influence see Gingerich pp The situation changed completely when Kepler came into contact at Prague with Tycho s observations which as Kepler often reports were seldom at his disposal However a change of attitude is evident in AN where he used Tycho s observations without restriction which is something he makes clear in the work s title In part chap he presents the vicarious hypothesis which in the end he refutes This hypothesis represents the best result which can be reached within the limits of traditional astronomy This works with circular orbits and with the supposition that the motion of a planet appears regular from a point on the lines of apsides Against the traditional method here Kepler does not cut the eccentricity into equal parts but leaves the partition open To check his hypothesis he needs observations of Mars in opposition where Mars the Earth and the Sun are at midnight on the same line From Tycho he inherited ten such observations between the years and and to them he added another two for and In chapters Kepler carries out an observational and computational check of his vicarious hypothesis On the one hand he points out that this hypothesis is good enough since the variations of the calculated positions from the observed positions fall within the limits of acceptability minutes of arc In fact Kepler presents this hypothesis as the best hypothesis which can be proposed within the framework of a traditional astronomy as opposed to his new astronomy which he will offer in the following parts of the work On the other hand this hypothesis can be falsified if one takes the observations of the latitudes into consideration Further calculations with these observations produce a difference of eight minutes something that cannot be assumed because the observations of Tycho are reliable enough Kepler s famous sentence runs these eight minutes alone will have led the way to the reformation of all of astronomy AN KGW p Engl trans p There seems to be agreement that Kepler s AN contains the first explicit consideration of the problem of observational error for this question see Hon and Field Kepler also gave an important place to experience in the field of optics As a matter of fact he began his research on optics because of a disagreement between theory and observation and he made use of scientific instruments he had designed himself see for instance KGW p Recent research on the problem of the camera obscura and the images in the air shows however the limits of a traditional approach to Kepler s optics following the main current of the history of physics Rather his notion of experimentum needs to be contextualized within the social practices and epistemological commitments of his time see Dupr Finally it should be mentioned that a similar significance is assigned to experience and empirical data in Kepler s harmonic musical and astrological theories two fields which are subordinated to his greater cosmological project of HM For astrology he uses meteorological data which he recorded for many years as confirmation material This material shows that the Earth as a whole living being reacts to the aspects which occur regularly in the heavens see Boner pp In his musical theory Kepler was a modern thinker especially because of the role he gave to experience As has been noted Walker p Kepler made acoustic experiments with a monochord long before he wrote his HM In a letter to Herwart von Hohenburg KGW ep p he describes how he checked the sound of a string at different lengths establishing in which cases the ear judges the sound to be pleasurable Kepler does not accept that this limitation is founded on arithmetical speculations even if this was already assumed by Plato whom he often follows and by the Pythagoreans On the basis of his experiments Kepler found that there are other divisions of the string that the ear perceives as consonant i e thirds and sixths If cosmology is the main framework of Kepler s interest there is no doubt that as Field has pointed out he felt the need to seek observational support for his model of the Universe Field p see also Field Today Kepler is remembered in the history of sciences above all for his three planetary laws which he produced in very specific contexts and at different times While it is questionable whether he would have understood these scientific statements as laws and it is even arguable that he used this term with a different meaning than we do today it seems to be clear that all three laws as a linguistic convention we may continue to use the term suppose some fundamentals of Kepler s philosophy a realism b causality c the geometric structure of the cosmos Besides this it should be remarked that the common denominator of all three laws is Kepler s defense of the Copernican worldview a cosmological system which he was not able to defend without reforming it radically see Goldstein and Hon It took of course more than ten years of sustained work to establish the new astronomy on a physical basis as Kepler had always intended However he was convinced early on of the central both positional and physical role that must be attributed to the Sun see Granada It is noteworthy that already at the very beginning of his career Kepler vehemently defended the reality of the Copernican worldview in a way that he characterized taking over the terminology from the standard Aristotelian epistemology as a priori see above Section above and Di Liscia Figure Kepler s first law of ellipse and second law of areas modern representation with greatly exaggerated eccentricity The first two laws were published initially in AN although it is known that Kepler had arrived at these results much earlier His first law establishes that the orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun in one of the foci see Figure According to the second law the radius vector from the Sun to a planet P sweeps out equal areas for instance SP P and SP P in equal times The planet P is therefore faster at perihelion where it is closer to the Sun and slower at aphelion where it is farther from the Sun In accordance with his dynamical approach Kepler first found the second law and then as a further result because of the effect produced by the supposed force the elliptical path of the planets for the two first planetary laws see especially Aiton a Davis a e and a Donahue Wilson and for Kepler s system of conics in connection with his optics see the recent study by Del Centina Perhaps the most significant impact of Kepler s two laws can be found by considering their cosmological consequences The first law abolishes the old axiom of the circular orbits of the planets an axiom which was still valid not only for pre Copernican astronomy and cosmology but also for Copernicus himself and for Tycho and Galileo The second law breaks with another axiom of traditional astronomy according to which the motion of the planets is uniform in swiftness The Ptolemaic tradition in astronomy was of course aware of this difficulty and applied a particularly effective device for saving the appearance of acceleration the equant Copernicus for his own part insisted on the necessity of the axiom of uniform circular motion Ptolemy s equant was understood by Copernicus as a technical device based on the violation of this axiom Kepler on the contrary affirms the reality of changes in the velocities of the planetary motions and provides a physical account for them After struggling strenuously with established ideas which were located not only in the tradition before him but also in his own thinking Kepler abandoned the circular path of planetary motion and in this way initiated a more empirical approach to cosmology though see Brackenridge Kepler published the third law the so called harmonic law for the first time in his Harmonice mundi i e ten years later In his Epitome he provided a more systematic approach to all three laws their grounds and implications see Davis Stephenson In Book chapter as point of KGW p Engl trans pp Kepler expresses almost accidentally his fundamental relationship connecting elapsed times with distances which in modern notation could be expressed as with T and T representing the periodic times of two planets and a and a the length of their semi major axes A further formulation of this relationship which is often found in the literature is a T K which expresses with K that the relationship between the third power of the distances and the square of the times is a constant however see Davis pp for the third planetary law see especially Stephenson As a consequence of the third law the time a planet takes to travel around the Sun will significantly increase the farther away it is or the longer the radius of its orbit Thus for instance Saturn s sidereal period is almost years while Mercury needs fewer than days to go around the Sun For the history of cosmology it is important to make clear that the third law fulfils Kepler s search for a systematic representation and defense of the Copernican worldview in which planets are not absolutely independent of each other but integrated in a harmonic world system Kepler contributed to the special field of optics with two seminal works the Ad Vitellionem paralipomena APO and the Dioptrice DI the latter motivated in large part by the publication in of Galileo s Sidereal Messenger Sidereus Nuncius In his Conversation with the Sidereal Messenger Dissertatio cum Nuncio Sidereo a Galillaeo Galilaeo KGW pp he supported the factual information given by Galileo indicating at the same time the necessity of giving an account of the causes of the observed phenomena The background for his investigation into optics was undoubtedly the different particular questions of astronomical optics see Straker In this context he concentrated his efforts on an explanation of the phenomena of eclipses of the apparent size of the Moon and of atmospheric refraction Kepler investigated the theory of the camera obscura very early and recorded its general principles see commentary by M Hammer in KGW pp and Straker In addition he worked intensively on the theory of the telescope and invented the refracting astronomical or Keplerian telescope which involved a considerable improvement over the Galilean telescope see especially DI Problem KGW pp Besides these impressive contributions Kepler expanded his research program to embrace mathematics as well as anatomy discussing for instance conic sections and explaining the process of vision see Crombie and especially Lindberg b In Chapter of APO On the Nature of Light Kepler expounds propositions concerning different properties of light light flows in all directions from every point of a body s surface it has no matter weight or resistance Following but also inverting the Aristotelian argument for the temporality of motion he affirms that the motion of light takes place not in time but in an instant in momento Light is propagated by straight lines rays which are not light itself but its motion It is important to note that although light travels from one body to another it is not a body but a two dimensional entity which tends to expand to a curved surface The two dimensionality of light is probably the main reason why it is incorporeal Motion in general plays a significant role in Kepler s philosophy of light For Straker the supposed link between optics and physics especially in Prop where the mechanical analyses are introduced reveals the full extent of his commitment to a mechanical physics of light Straker p Two questions are intensively discussed by modern specialists Firstly to what extent is the attribution of a mechanistic approach to Kepler justified Secondly how should one determine his place in the history of sciences especially in the field of optics do the main lines of thought in Kepler s optics indicate a continuity or rather a rupture with tradition There are well grounded arguments for different positions on both questions For Crombie and Straker Kepler develops a mechanical approach which can be particularly appreciated in his explanation of vision using the model of the camera obscura Besides this Straker stresses that Kepler s basic mechanicism is also powerfully assisted by his conception of light as a non active passive entity In addition the concept of motion and the explanations using the model of the balance are indicative of a commitment to mechanicism Straker pp On the contrary Lindberg a who supports the continuity side of the dispute has quite convincingly showed that for Kepler light has a constructive and active function in the universe not only in optics but also in astrology astronomy and natural philosophy for Kepler s criticism of the medieval tradition see also Chen Morris Unguru From a philosophical point of view Kepler considered the HM to be his main work and the one he most cherished Containing his third planetary law this work represents definitively a seminal contribution to the history of astronomy But he did not reduce his long prepared project to an astronomical investigation his first thoughts on the notion of harmony arose already in although he did not publish his work until but instead extensively discussed its mathematical foundations and its philosophical implications including astrology natural philosophy and psychology Thus Kepler s third planetary law appears in a context which goes far beyond astronomy and to a great extent takes up again the perspective of his youthful MC When talking about harmony in Kepler one needs to keep in mind that the background giving its full significance to this notion goes far beyond music theory Of course music is involved and plays a determining role and along with it the corresponding mathematical concepts stemming from the Pythagorean tradition However in Kepler harmony represents the most general idea the very core of the world as an ordered whole and therefore the ultimate goal to be pursued in his philosophical investigations Social and political aspects are also included It is surely not a minor detail that Kepler on the threshold of the Thirty Years War dedicated his HM to King James I of England the man whom Kepler believed was best suited to apply its lessons to the most pressing harmony of all the harmony of church and state Rothman p According to Kepler it is necessary to distinguish sensible from pure harmony The first is to be found among natural sensible entities like sounds in music or rays of light both could be in proportion to one another and hence in harmony He resolves this matter by combining three of the Aristotelian categories quantity relation and finally quality Through the function of the category of relation Kepler passes over to the active function of the mind or soul It turns out that two things can be characterized as harmonic if they can be compared according to the category of quantity But the fact that at least two things are needed shows that the property of being harmonic is not a property of an isolated thing Furthermore the relationship between the things cannot be found in the things themselves either rather it is produced by the mind in general every relation is nothing without mind apart from the things which it relates because they do not have the relation which they are said to have unless the presence of some mind is assumed to relate one to another KGW p Engl trans p This process takes place through the comparison of different sensible things with an archetype archetypus present in the mind The next central question directly concerns gnoseology for Kepler gives a psychological account of the path followed by sensible things into the mind He resumes the scholastic species theory immaterial species radiate from the sensible things and affect the sense organs by acting firstly on the forecourts and then on the internal functions for the notion of species in Kepler see Rabin which has found both favorable and critical reception in the literature They arrive at the imagination and from there go over to the sensus communis so that according to the traditional teaching the sensible information received is now able to be processed and used in statements From here onwards the sensible things are preserved in the memory brought forth by recollection and distinguished by the higher faculty of the soul Caspar p cf KGW p lines Engl trans p While harmony arises as an activity of the soul mind consisting in relating quantitatively Kepler adds taking over the Aristotelian doctrine of categories that harmony is a qualitative relation as well involving the quality of shape being formed from the regular figures which provides the grounds for comparison KGW p lines Engl trans p If this is how things i e sensible entities find their way into the soul in order to be compared it by no means represents as Kepler admitted a sufficient explanation of how non sensible things i e mathematical entities find their way into the mind How do they come into the soul Kepler accepted Aristotle s criticism of Pythagorean philosophy concerning numbers both Kepler and Aristotle are convinced that numbers constitute ontologically a lower class within mathematical entities for Kepler they are derived from geometrical entities Nevertheless Aristotle s philosophy is insufficient to grasp the essence of mathematics By aligning himself with Proclus from whom he quotes a long passage of his Commentary on Euclides Kepler defends Plato s theory of anamn sis against Aristotle s doctrine of the tabula rasa His discussion lies at the origin of the classical debate between empiricism and rationalism which was to dominate the philosophical scene for generations to come A connection with idealism is of course apparent see for instance Caspar Engl trans p and it is a fact that Kepler was positively received within German Idealism of the th century Schwaetzer esp Historically however it seems to be more accurate to link his position with the philosophical tradition of St Augustine Besides psychology and gnoseology the other main spectrum of questions Kepler deals with in Book is his theory of aspects i e astrology HM IV Cap a further field of application of his psychology and further evidence of the role of geometry in his philosophy The aspects i e the angles between the planets Moon and Sun are all he wishes to save from the old astrology which he harshly criticizes for the aspects are or can be reduced to geometrical structures the archetypes which can be recognized by the soul According to Kepler there is no mechanical influence of the heavens stars and constellations are not relevant in his astrology Nevertheless Kepler devoted considerable effort to determining the size of the stars and their role within his Copernican astronomy see Graney while maintaining however that the astrological configuration of the planets influences events on Earth and human life Rather both the Earth and human beings ultimately like all other living entities are provided with a soul in which the geometrical archetypes are present By the formation of an aspect in the heavens symmetry arises and stimulates the soul of the Earth or of human beings The Earth Kepler writes responds to what the aspects whistle KGW p for his astrology see especially Field and Rabin Boner and Aristotle Copernicus

The ethics of a society is embedded in the ideas and beliefs about what is right or wrong what is a good or bad character it is also embedded in the conceptions of satisfactory social relations and attitudes held by the members of the society it is embedded furthermore in the forms or patterns of behavior that are considered by the members of the society to bring about social harmony and cooperative living justice and fairness The ideas and beliefs about moral conduct are articulated analyzed and interpreted by the moral thinkers of the society African societies as organized and functioning human communities have undoubtedly evolved ethical systems ethical values principles rules intended to guide social and moral behavior But like African philosophy itself the ideas and beliefs of the African society that bear on ethical conduct have not been given elaborate investigation and clarification and thus stand in real need of profound and extensive analysis and interpretation In the last three decades or so attempts have been made by contemporary African philosophers to give sustained reflective attention to African moral ideas This entry is intended to make some contribution to the understanding of African ethical thinking The entry makes the African moral language its point of departure for the language of morality gives insight into the moral thinking or ideas of the society The centrality of the notions of character and moral personhood which are inspired by the African moral language is given a prominent place The entry points up the social character of African ethics and highlights its affiliated notions of the ethics of duty not of rights and of the common good The humanistic foundations and features of African ethics are extensively discussed The term ethics is technically used by philosophers to mean a philosophical study of morality morality understood as a set of social rules principles norms that guide or are intended to guide the conduct of people in a society and as beliefs about right and wrong conduct as well as good or bad character Even though morality is the subject matter of ethics it is most often used interchangeably with ethics In spite of the philosophical inquiries or analyses undertaken by individual moral philosophers regarding morality i e the morality of a society or people analyses which often result in diverse positions or conclusions nevertheless the basic features the core elements of the morality of a society those moral principles and values that actually guide and influence the lives of a people remain pretty much what they are or have been What individual moral philosophers through their critical analyses and arguments try to do is to explain clarify refine sharpen or enlarge the understanding of the concepts and issues of morality Even though the moral beliefs and circumstances of their own societies constitute the immediate focus of their philosophical activities for human experience is most directly felt within some specific social or cultural context nevertheless moral philosophers do not think or imply at all that the results of their reflective activities are to be tethered to their own societies as such They believe to the contrary that in the light of our common humanity which speaks to the common sentiments purposes responses hopes and aspirations of all human beings in respect of certain situations the conclusions of their reflections would surely have implications for the capacious community of humankind for the universal human family Thus moral principles and rules may emerge from or evolved by a particular human society even so they are principles that can and do apply to all human societies inasmuch as they respond to basic human needs interests and purposes When the Akan moralist maintains for instance that To possess virtue is better than gold or When virtue founds a town the town thrives and abides he strongly believes that he is making a moral statement he is enunciating a moral principle that transcends his own community and applies not only to other towns in his nation but indeed to all human societies just as Socrates surely intended his celebrated moral statement Virtue is knowledge whether true or not to apply to peoples and cultures beyond Athens and Greece even beyond fifth century Greece Thus the moral intent of the morally freighted proverbs or maxims discussed in this entry is considered relevant to the moral life of the human being and as such is purported to have universal application or reference After the reflective activities of the individual moral thinkers the beliefs and presuppositions of a people about right and wrong conduct good and bad character all of which featured in the moral life of the people prior to the activities of moral thinkers remain substantially or generally unscathed they continue to constitute the moral framework within which the members of the society function Thus even though a theoretical or academic distinction can be made between morality as constituted by the moral beliefs and principles that a group of people abides by in their daily lives let us refer to this kind of morality as morality and morality or ethics as comprising the reflections of moral thinkers on human conduct on morality let us refer to the reflective enterprise regarding morality as morality nevertheless to the extent that morality provides a clarification and better explanation and understanding of morality it can be said that the two terms morality and ethics refer essentially to the same moral phenomenon human conduct and thus can be used interchangeably Thus in this entry the term African ethics is used to refer both to the moral beliefs and presuppositions of the sub Saharan African people and the philosophical clarification and interpretation of those beliefs and presuppositions I take note of a view expressed by some philosophers on Aristotle s ethics Bertrand Russell observed that Aristotle s opinions on moral questions are always such as were conventional in his day This view is re echoed by Hardie Aristotle s moral ideas and moral ideals are in some degree the product of his time he also asserts that Aristotle in the Nicomachean Ethics is at least in part an interpreter of Greek experience W F R Hardie In the same way this entry present an interpretretation of the moral ideas and values as found in the African moral language conceptions of society conceptions of a person and so on Also in this entry African refers to the salient features or ideas of the African moral life and thought generally as reflected in or generated by African moral language and social structure and life Many writers have made the observation that despite the indisputable cultural diversity that arises from Africa s ethnic pluralism there are underlying affinities in many areas of the African life this is surely true in the African religious and moral outlook There are some features of the moral life and thought of various African societies that according to the cited sources are common or shared features There are other features that can be seen as common on conceptual or logical grounds For instance the claim that the values and principles of African morality are not founded on religion simply derives from the characterization of traditional African religion as a non revealed religion In the history of the indigenous religion in African it does not seem that anyone in any African community has ever claimed to have received a revelation from the Supreme Being intended either for the people of the community or for all humanity This characterization makes African ethics independent of religion and thus underlines the notion of the autonomy of ethics in regard to African ethics If a religion is a non revealed religion then it is independent of religious prescriptions and commands The characterization of traditional African religion would thus lead me to assert to generalize on logical grounds that the moral system of each African society in the traditional setting does not derive from religion thus it is an autonomous moral system Similarly the claim about the social non individualistic morality of the African society is closely related to the community and shared life of the African people And so on Thus while Akan ethics is not a microcosm of African ethics there is nevertheless evidence both empirical and conceptual that indicates that the values beliefs and principles of Akan ethics reverberate mutatis mutandis on the moral terrains of other African societies Based on the qualifying expression mutatis mutandis allowing for necessary variations and adjustments it would be correct to say that the term African ethics is appropriate With all this said however neither Akan nor African ethics would be unique among the ethical systems evolved by the various non African cultures of the world We would begin with an inquiry into African moral language in search specifically of the word for ethics in a few African languages Such an inquiry will give some insight into the basic conception and understanding of ethics or morality It must be noted right from the outset that a substantial number of Sub Saharan African languages do not have words that can be said to be direct equivalents of the word ethics or morality Here are some interesting results of inquiries made from native speakers of a few African languages and how statements about a person s ethical or moral conduct are expressed in those languages including two of the prominent languages in Ghana Akan the author s native language and Ewe Thus the inquiries into the moral language of several African peoples or cultures indicate that in these languages the word or expression that means character is used to refer to what others call ethics or morality Discourses or statements about morality turn to be discourses or statements essentially about character In Islamic moral philosophy the word used for ethics namely akhlaq means character The implication here is that ethics or morality is conceived in terms essentially of character It is noteworthy that the Greek word ethike from which the English word ethics derives means character ethos What we call ethics Aristotle calls the study or science of character he ethike For the Greek as for the African and the Arab the character of the individual matters most in our moral life and thought There are of course other moral concepts in the African moral language and thought The concepts of good bad or evil right and wrong feature prominently in African moral thought as they do in the moral systems of other peoples and cultures In Akan for instance pa or papa means good and bone means bad or evil see below Thus the expression onipa bone means a bad person A bad person is said to be a person with a bad character suban bone When a person is known to be honest or generous or compassionate he would be judged by the Akan as a good person by which they mean that he has a good character suban A person would be judged as having a bad character if he is considered dishonest wicked or cruel In most moral evaluations reference is made to the character of a person thus character is basic the crucial element in Akan as it is in African ethics generally Iwa character is for the Yoruba perhaps the most important moral concept A person is morally evaluated according to his her iwa whether good or bad Gbadegesin African ethics is thus a character based ethics that maintains that the quality of the individual s character is most fundamental in our moral life Good character is the essence of the African moral system the linchpin of the moral wheel The justification for a character based ethics is not far to seek For all that a society can do regarding moral conduct is to impart moral knowledge to its members making them aware of the moral values and principles of that society In general society satisfactorily fulfills this duty of imparting moral knowledge to its members through moral education of various forms including as in African societies telling morally freighted proverbs and folktales to its younger members But having moral knowledge being made aware of the moral principles and rules of the society is one thing being able to lead a life consonant with the moral principles is quite another An individual may know and may even accept a moral rule such as say it is wrong to cheat the customs But he may fail to apply this rule to a particular situation he is thus not able to effect the transition from knowledge to action to carry out the implications of his moral belief In the Akan and other African moral systems such a moral failure would be put down to the lack of a good character suban pa In other words the ability to act in accord with the moral principles and rules of the society requires the possession of a good character Thus in the context of the activities of the moral life in our decisions to obey moral rules in the struggle to do the right thing and to avoid the wrong conduct in one s intention to carry out a moral duty the quality of a person s character is of ultimate consequence It is from a person s character that all his or her actions good or bad radiate the performance of good or bad acts depends on the state of one s character Wrong doing is put down to a person s bad character Thus the Yoruba maxim proverb Good character is a person s guard African maxims are explicit about the formation of character character is acquired A person is therefore responsible for the state of his or her character for character results from the habitual actions of a person An Akan maxim has it that one is not born with a bad head but one takes it on from the earth The maxim means among other things that a bad habit is not an inborn characteristic it is one that is acquired It would be worthless to embark on moral instruction through moral proverbs and folktales as it is done in African societies if our character or habits were inborn But the belief is that the moral narratives would help the young people to acquire and internalize the moral values of the society including specific moral virtues embedded in those ethical narratives The appropriate responses to moral instruction are expected to lead to the acquisition of appropriate habits and their corresponding characters And because character is acquired through our actions habits and expected responses to moral instructions it can according to African moral systems be changed or reformed Character is defined by the Akan thinkers in terms of habits which result from a person s deeds or actions character comes from your actions or deeds nneyee says an Akan traditional thinker Persistent performance of a particular action will produce a certain habit and thus a corresponding character To acquire virtue a person must perform good actions that is morally acceptable actions so that they become habitual The action or deed that led to the acquisition of a newly good habit must be persistently performed in order to strengthen that habit in this way virtue or good character is acquired Over time such an acquired virtue becomes a habit This is the position of Akan ethics on the development and acquisition of a good or bad character for this is what the Akan people mean when they say aka ne ho it has remained with him it has become part of him it has become his habit Character is thus a behavior pattern formed as a result of past persistent actions Thus moral virtues excellences of character or vices arise through habituation The logic of the acquisition of our character or habits is that the original nature of the human being was morally neutral neither good nor bad A person s original moral neutrality will in the course of his life come to be affected in one direction the good or the other direction the bad by his actions and responses to moral instruction advice and persuasion The original moral neutrality of a human being constitutes the foundation of our conception of the moral person for it makes for allows room for choice that is moral choice Consequently what a person does or does not do is most crucial to the formation and development of his or her character and thus to becoming moral or immoral Let me start the analysis of moral personhood in African moral philosophy with a statement made by Ifeanyi Menkiti an African philosopher from Nigeria Menkiti s statement adumbrates a conception of moral personhood which will now be discussed in some detail The concept of a person in African thought embodies ethical presuppositions The word used for person in the Akan language undoubtedly the most widely spoken language in Ghana is onipa But the word onipa also means human being and the plural form of it means people Thus the word onipa is an ambiguous word In the Akan society when an individual s conduct very often appears cruel wicked selfish ungenerous or unsympathetic it would be said of that individual that he is not a person onnye onipa In Yoruba language the word eniyan means a person Even though the word is used in a normative as well as non normative or ordinary sense greater emphasis is placed on the normative dimension of eniyan Gbadagesin It can be said of some human individual that he or she is not a person Ki i se eniyan Such a comment is a judgment of the moral standing of the human being who is thus determined to fall short of what it takes to be recognized as such Gbadagesin The Akan statement onnye onipa and the Yoruba statement Ki i se eniyan both underline a conception of moral personhood The two statements are significant in two ways The first is that even though that individual is said not to be a person he is nonetheless acknowledged as a human being not a beast or fish It is pretty clear that the statement implies a distinction between the concept of a human being and the concept of a person an individual can be a human being without being a person The second significant thing the statements imply is the assumption that there are certain fundamental norms and ideals to which the conduct of a human being if he is a person ought to conform that there are moral virtues that an individual has the capacity to display in his conduct and ought to display them if he is a person The reason for the judgment that an individual is not a person if he behaves or does not behave in a certain way is that that individual s actions and behavior are considered as falling short of the ideals and standards of personhood But it does not imply at all that an individual considered not a person loses his rights as a human being or as a citizen or that people in the community should cease to demonstrate a moral concern for him or display the appropriate moral virtues in their treatment of him only that he is not considered a morally worthy individual Now the judgment that a human being is not a person made in the wake of that individual s persistent unethical behavior implies that the practice of moral virtue is considered intrinsic to the conception of a person held in Akan or Yoruba moral thought The position here is this for any p if p is person then p ought to display in his behavior the moral norms and ideals of personhood When the behavior of a human being fails to conform to the acceptable moral principles or standards or when a human being fails to display the expected moral virtues in his conduct he is considered to be not a person The evaluative judgment opposite to the one we have been considering is he is a person oye onipa This judgment is not a descriptive judgment at all even though it can be used descriptively as when in a forest one hunter made that judgment to his colleague hunter who thought he saw a beast and was about to shoot it the judgment he is a person oye onipa would in that context be used descriptively by the other hunter to distinguish a human being from a beast Thus a descriptive use of that judgment would be obvious and easily understood What I am concerned to point up in the present circumstance is the normative form of the judgment Used normatively the judgment he is a person means he has a good character he is generous he is peaceful he is humble he has respect for others A profound appreciation of the high standards of the morality of an individual s behavior would elicit the judgment he is truly a person oye onipa paa A rider would be in place here while children are actual human beings and are members of the human community they are not actual persons yet they are persons only potentially and will attain the status of personhood in the fullness of time when they are able to exercise their moral capacity and make moral judgments Now the denial of personhood to a human being on the grounds that his actions are not in accord with certain fundamental norms and ideals of personhood or that that individual fails to display certain virtues in his behavior is morally significant and worth noting It means that human nature is considered in Akan metaphysical and moral thought to be essentially good not depraved or warped by some original sin that the human being is capable of doing good It does not mean however that personhood in this model of humanity is innate but is earned in the ethical arena it is the individual s moral achievement that earns him the status of a person Every individual is capable of becoming a person inasmuch as he has capacity for virtue for performing morally right actions and should be treated at least potentially as a morally responsible agent In this connection let us pay some attention to the Akan belief embedded in a maxim that says God created every human being to be good Onyame boo obiara yie The view expressed in this proverb seems to be at variance with the notion of the moral neutrality of the human being discussed earlier in connection with character section The meaning of the maxim God created every human to be good is not too clear it may be interpreted in two ways First it may be taken as implying that God created the human being actually to do good that is to actually behave virtuously and to always make the appropriate moral choices Second it may be interpreted as meaning that God made the human being capable of moral choice that is that the human being was merely endowed by his creator with the moral sense to distinguish between good and evil right and wrong The first interpretation implies that the human being has been determined to be good to actually pursue virtue thus the human being s moral status is a settled matter If the human being were created or determined actually and always to do good there would never have been a concept of evil or vice bone in Akan moral language since no human being would in that kind of moral context commit a vicious or evil act In light of the evil and unethical actions of individual human beings the first interpretation which implies that the human being is resiliently good cannot be accepted as the correct meaning of the maxim for it is plainly contradicted by our putative moral experience The first interpretation also subverts moral neutrality a consequence that eliminates moral choice basic to the notion of a moral person The second interpretation of the view that the human being was created good or to be good implies that the human being merely has the capacity for virtue that is could pursue good but could also pursue evil This means that the human being is endowed with moral sense and so has the capacity for both virtue and vice his judgment on some moral issue could go either direction direction of the good or direction of the evil Thus the notion of moral neutrality is preserved The human being can then be held as a moral agent not that his virtuous character is a settled matter but that he is capable of virtue and hence of moral achievement and can thus achieve personhood The correctness of the second interpretation of the view that the human being was created good as argued in the foregoing paragraphs can have an anchor also in the Akan notion of tiboa conscience moral sense a sense of right or wrong This is a conception of an inner urge relevant to moral practice Tiboa is held among other things as creating a sense of guilt in the individual convicting him or her of wrong deeds Since response to a moral rule is ultimately an individual or private affair the notion of tiboa conscience is of great importance to our moral life It is by virtue of tiboa that the notion of self sanctioning in moral conduct becomes intelligible Because of its power to induce a sense of guilt tiboa is held to influence the individual s moral choice decision response and attitude The reality or phenomenon of moral choice is a rejection of the notion of a fixed or settled moral character of an individual that derives from the presupposition albeit false that the human being is born virtuous The activity of tiboa is in line with the moral neutrality of the human being at birth The activity of tiboa assists moral achievement and thus moral personhood Like the Akan people and others the Rwanda or Ruanda people also have the concept of conscience The Rwanda word for conscience kamera means something that is internally felt It is situated in the heart J J Maquet in Forde There indeed are external social sanctions which are useful as deterrents from prohibited behavior but in moral motivation feelings of moral guilt and shame are traceable also to kamera or tiboa Observations have been made by a number of scholars that Africans are a very even a notoriously religious people that religion so deeply permeates all spheres of their lives that it cannot be distinguished from nonreligious aspects of life that in the African traditional life there are no atheists and that the African cultural heritage is intensely and pervasively religious Historical evidence indicates that many colonial administrators in their dispatches to their colonial metropolis used to refer to Africans as this incurably religious people Assertions about the religiosity of the African people have led some scholars to maintain that there is a connection between religion and morality in African ethics That some connection may exist between religion and morality is conceivable in an environment that is widely alleged to be pervasively religious But the nature of the connection needs to be fully clarified The connection has been taken by most scholars to mean that African moral values and principles derive from religion implying that African morality is thus a religious morality Opoku Danquah Sarpong Busia Parrinder Idowu The claim implies in turn that the moral beliefs and principles of the African people derive from those of religion that religion provides the necessary justification for moral values and beliefs and that moral concepts such as good bad right and wrong are defined or must be defined in terms of religious prescriptions or commands However there are other scholars such as Godfrey Wilson Monica Wilson Maquet Wiredu who deny the religious basis of the moral systems of the societies they studied Kwasi Wiredu observed that the Akan moral outlook is thus logically independent of religion Kwasi Wiredu in H Odera Oruka and D A Masolo Godfrey Wilson wrote that Among the Nyakyusa the ideas of social behaviour are not connected with religion nonetheless they exist and after mentioning the moral virtues of the Nyakyusa he added that But the positive ideal statement of these virtues is not made in religious terms Godfrey Wilson in Ottenberg and Ottenberg eds On the morality of the Rwanda Maquet wrote that Thus the ethics of the Banyarwanda are not integrated on a religious basis such as the will of God J J Maquet in Forde In Mende ethics Wrongbehavior is regarded as a breaking of some specific rule of conduct not as the flouting of some divine or absolute law of the universe Kenneth Little in Forde These are unambiguous statements of the nonreligious foundation of the morality of at least some African societies The claim made by many scholars that African morality is founded on or derives from religion cannot in my opinion be upheld if by morality we are referring to social principles and norms that guide the conduct of people in a society One reason is that unlike Islam or Christianity the traditional that is indigenous African religion is not a revealed religion whereby divine truth is revealed to a single individual who becomes the founder It is true that African religious experience certainly features mystical or highly spiritual encounters between human beings that is priests priestesses diviners etc and spiritual beings Such encounters occur in divinations spirit mediums communication with the dead and other forms of the mystical experience But it may be noted such mystical or spiritual encounters or contacts take place in an atmosphere that was already religious they are some of the manifestations of African religion of African spirituality I define spirituality as a heightened form of religiosity reached by certain individuals in the community who have or claim to have mystical contacts with the supernatural the divine It would be correct to assert however that the encounters are the results rather than the sources of religion in Africa in the traditional setting And even though spiritual messages may be received by the practitioners of traditional African religion through those mystical encounters part of which messages may relate to moral conduct nevertheless such messages appear to be too few and far between to constitute an adequate basis for a coherent ethical system Moreover the moral character of such messages would in a non revealed religious context have to be judged by the people themselves on the basis of their own moral insights This is a telling point that implies the independence autonomy of the moral attitudes of the people with regard to the conduct of the spiritual beings This is the reason why an eminent Ghanaian sociologist observed that The gods are treated with respect if they deliver the goods and with contempt if they fail Attitudes to the gods depend on their success i e the success of the gods and vary from healthy respect to sneering contempt K A Busia in Forde The moral disapprobation of the people with regard to the actions particularly the unsuccessful actions of the deities constitutes the ground for the extinction of some of the deities from the Akan possibly the African pantheon The fact that the behavior of a supernatural being is thus subject to human censure implies that it is possible for a deity to issue commands that can be considered unethical by the practitioners of traditional religion All this implies surely that it would be correct to assert that rather than regarding African ethics as religious or religious based it would be more correct to regard African religion as ethical In a revealed religion what is revealed is generally elaborate and can be conceived to include moral principles and ideals as part of the will of God thus revealed A morality that is founded on religion is thus a necessary concomitant of a revealed religion Since the indigenous African religion is not a revealed religion there is no way by which the people would have access to the will of God that contains elaborate moral principles upon which a coherent moral system can be erected In the context of a non revealed religion then to make divine or supernatural commands the source of moral values and principles would be conceptually impossible Now how are the moral concepts of good evil right and wrong understood or defined in African ethics When put to traditional sages thinkers of some Akan communities in Ghana the question how do we come to know that this action is good and that action is evil no one responded that an action is good or evil because God Onyame had said so or that Onyame had told us so Thus what is morally good or right is not that which is commanded by God or pleasing to God or any spiritual being or that which is in accordance with the will of a spiritual being The responses revealed on the contrary an undoubted conviction of a humanistic a non supernatural origin of moral values and principles a conviction that provided insight into the Akan conception of the criterion of moral value According to the ethics of the Banyarwanda That is good or evil which tradition has defined as good or evil J J Maquet loc cit In light of the non revealed nature of traditional African religion it can be said that the view regarding the non religious non supernatural origin of moral principles and values would resonate on the moral terrains of most other African communities The sources of African morality in the traditional setting then must be held as independent of religious prescriptions or supernatural powers The views of the traditional thinkers indicate that what is good is constituted by the deeds habits and behavior patterns considered by the society as worthwhile because of their consequences for human welfare The goods would include such things as generosity honesty faithfulness truthfulness compassion hospitality happiness that which brings peace justice respect and so on Each of these actions or patterns of behavior is supposed or known to bring about social well being In Akan moral system or African moral system generally good or moral value is determined in terms of its consequences for humankind and human society All this can be interpreted to mean that African morality originates from considerations of human welfare and interests not from divine pronouncements Actions that promote human welfare or interest are good while those that detract from human welfare are bad It is thus pretty clear that African ethics is a humanistic ethics a moral system that is preoccupied with human welfare Referring to African morality generally Monica Wilson observed that The basis of morality was fulfillment of obligation to kinsmen and neighbors and living in amity with them In African conceptions moral values originate from the basic existential conditions in which human beings organize and conduct their lives McVeigh made the following observation In the ethics of the Lovedu a South Bantu ethnic group of the Transvaal And regarding the basis of Bantu morality Molema remarked Statements and references made in the immediately foregoing paragraphs indicate the nonreligious foundation of African ethics Now having removed African ethics from its alleged religious moorings where do we moor it The answer based on the foregoing references is that we moor it to the preoccupations of the African society with human welfare and social harmony to reflections on the existential conditions in which human beings function Not being a revealed religion traditional African religion can be characterized as a natural religion a religion that derives from the peoples own reflections on this complex world and their experiences in it The African metaphysic to be sure is a theistic metaphysic yet it does not nurture a theistic or supernatural ethic Just as it was their own reflections that led to the creation of a natural religion so it was their own reflections on living a harmonious and cooperative life in a human society that led to the creation of a natural a humanistic ethic Thus side by side with Africa s natural religion or theology is a natural ethic grounded in human experiences in living together a society oriented morality that thus arises from the existential conditions in which people conduct their lives And so it is that the moral values of the African people have a social and humanistic rather than a religious basis and are fashioned according to the people s own understanding of the nature of human society human relations human goals and the meaning of human life with its emotional features With all this said however it cannot be denied that religion plays some role in the moral lives of people such as African people who are said to be incurably religious Because God is held by the African people not only to be the overlord of the human society but also to have a superbly moral character and because the ancestors ancestral spirits are also supposed to be interested in the welfare of the society they left behind including the moral life of the individual religion constitutes part of the sanctions that are in play in matters of moral practice Thus religion cannot be totally banished from the domain of moral practice notwithstanding the fact that the moral values and principles of the African society do not derive from religion Humanism the doctrine that takes human welfare interests and needs as fundamental constitutes the foundation of African ethics It is the warp and woof the African moral life and thought Indeed African prayers and other acts of worship are brimful of or characterized by requests to the supernatural beings for material comforts such as prosperity health and riches And even though the African people do not consider God and other supernatural beings as the sources of their moral values and principles nevertheless they are ever aware of the powers of the supernatural beings and are ever ready to exploit their munificence for the promotion of human welfare prosperity and happiness These two concepts humanity and brotherhood feature prominently in African social and moral thought and practice They are among the moral or human values that constitute the basic perhaps the ultimate criteria that not only motivate but also justify human actions that affect other human beings In African terms humanity is not just an anthropological term it is also a moral term when it comes to considering the relations between members of the human species The term brotherhood has come to refer to an association of men and or women with common aims and interests But the notion of brotherhood is essentially a moral notion for it is about the relations between individual human beings that make for their own interest and well being There is some affiliation between humanity and brotherhood in African ethical conceptions if we are human we are must be brothers in a capacious comprehensive sense of the word brother to be discussed shortly We start our discussion with the Akan maxim The Akan maxim literally means In human flesh there is no edge of cultivation no boundary nhanoa The maxim can be interpreted as meaning that all humankind is one species thus that Humanity has no boundary When the farmer cultivates his land he does it up to a limit an edge in Akan nhanoa edge boundary where he has to stop otherwise he would trespass on another farmer s land There is thus a limit to the area of cultivation of land But this the maxim invites us to realize is not so in the cultivation of the friendship and fellowship of human beings the boundaries of that form of cultivation are limitless For humanity is of one kind all humankind is one species with shared basic values feelings hopes and desires This is most probably the reason why in almost all the autochthonous African languages here I exclude African languages like Hausa and Swahili that have borrowed a substantial number of Arabic words there is really no word for race There are instead the words person human being and people So that where others would speak in terms of the black race or the white race Africans would say black people white people and so on And instead of people of mixed race they would say people of mixed blood The latter expression however is somewhat vague since it also describes people of dual ethnic parentage in African societies But in terms of the African perception of humanity the important point is that the offspring of any blood mixing is a human being and therefore belongs to the one human race of which we are all a part Thus even though the African people traditionally live in small communities and are divided into different ethnic or cultural groups and into clans and lineages with complex networks of relationships nevertheless they perceive humanity to embrace all other peoples beyond their narrow geographic or spatial confines to constitute all human beings into one universal family of humankind Even though this family is fragmented into a multiplicity of peoples and cultures nevertheless it is a shared family a shared humanity the relationships among whose members ought to feature a certain kind of morality the morality of a shared humanity The common membership of one universal human family constitutes should constitute a legitimate basis for the idea of universal human brotherhood or unity This idea is depicted in for instance the Akan maxim The maxim asserts unmistakably that a human being can be related only to another human being not to a beast Implicit in the African perception of humanity is the recognition of all persons irrespective of their racial or ethnic backgrounds as brothers This is the reason why in African cultures the word brother is used to cover various and complex family relationships linked by blood ties But the word is also used significantly by persons between whom there are no blood ties thus the word is used comprehensively The comprehensive meaning given to the word brother in African cultures is intended indeed to lift people up from the purely biologically determined blood relation level onto the human level the level where the essence of humanity is held as transcending the contingencies of human biology race ethnicity or culture A practical translation of the idea of brotherhood leads to such social and moral virtues as hospitality generosity concern for others and communal feeling Several writers including European travelers to Africa in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries have remarked upon these virtues as practiced in African social and moral life A Briton who spent about three decades in Central Africa from the latter part of the nineteenth century to the early part of the twentieth century made the following observation And a contemporary African writer also notes Most people including foreign visitors to Africa often testify in amazement to the ethic of hospitality and generosity of the African people That ethic is an expression of the perception of our common humanity and universal human brotherhood As regards the African conception of the worth and dignity of the human being there is time to refer only to a couple of Akan maxims One such maxim is In this maxim a human being is depicted as beautiful That which is beautiful is enjoyed for its own sake not for the sake of anything else What the maxim is saying therefore is that a human being is to be enjoyed for his or her own sake To enjoy a human being for his her own sake means you should appreciate his value as a human being and demonstrate that appreciation by showing compassion generosity and hospitality It means you should be open to the interests and welfare of others and feel it a moral duty to offer help where it is needed To enjoy a human being also means you should recognize the other person as a fellow individual whose worth as a human being is equal to yours and with whom you undoubtedly share basic values ideals and sentiments Thus the main intent of the maxim is to point out the worth of a human being and the respect that ought to be given to her by virtue of her humanity Recognition of the worth of a human being is according to the maxim more important than caring for wealth Kenneth Kaunda describes in some detail how the enjoyment of people is expressed in practical terms The value of the human being is expressed also in the following maxim It is the human being that counts I call upon gold it answers not I call upon cloth it answers not it is the human being that counts Onipa ne asem mefre sika a sika nnye so mefre ntama a ntama nnye so onipa ne asem The maxim says that it is only the human being that is of real value for in times of need or distress if you appeal to gold and other material possessions they will not respond only a human being will For these reasons the worth of the human being is of the ultimate consequence and ought therefore to be given the ultimate consideration From such maxims one can appreciate why human welfare and concern constitute the preoccupation of African ethics The notion of the common good features manifestly in African ethics In Akan moral thought the notion is expressed most vividly in an art motif that shows a siamese crocodile with two heads but a single i e common stomach The part of the motif relevant to moral thought is the single stomach and it is to the significance of this that I wish to pay some attention The common stomach of the two crocodiles indicates that at least the basic interests of all the members of the community are identical It can therefore be interpreted as symbolizing the common good the good of all the individuals within a society The common good is not a surrogate for the sum of the various individual goods It does not consist of or derive from the goods and preferences of particular individuals It is that which is essentially good for human beings as such embracing the needs that are basic to the enjoyment and fulfillment of the life of each individual If the common good were the aggregate of individual goods it would only be contingently not essentially common and on that score it would not be achieved in a way that will benefit all the individuals in a society If the common good is achieved then the individual good is also achieved Thus there should be no conceptual tension or opposition between the common good and the good of the individual member of the community for the common good embraces the goods the basic goods of all the members of the community If the common good were understood as the basic good as human good as such there would be no need to think of it as a threat to individual liberty as touted by Western liberal individualist thinkers for after all individual liberty is held as one of the basic goods of the members of the society The contents of the common stomach in the symbolic art of the siamese crocodile would not conflict with the interests and needs of either of the crocodiles The good as discussed in an earlier section is defined by the traditional thinkers of the Akan society in terms of peace happiness or satisfaction human flourishing justice dignity respect and so on The common good embraces these goods and more There is no human being who does not desire peace security freedom dignity respect justice equality and satisfaction It is such a moral not a weird notion embracive of fundamental goods goods that are intrinsic to human fulfillment and to which all individuals desire to have access that is referred to as the common good The unrelenting support by people in a community for such moral values as social justice and equality on the one hand and the spontaneous universal denunciation of acts such as murder and cruelty on the other hand are certainly inspired by beliefs in the common good Similarly the institutions of various kinds legal political economic moral and others are set up in pursuit of certain commonly shared values and goals that is a common good which a human society desires to achieve for all of its members The institution of government or legal system is surely based on a common understanding of the need for societal values of social order and social peace It is thus pretty clear that the common good is that which inspires the creation of a moral social political or legal system for enhancing the well being of people in a community The common good is a notion that is conceptually affiliated to the notion of community and thus to the notion of human society as such The common good is an essential feature of the ethics espoused by the communitarian African society The pursuit of the good of all is the goal of the communitarian society which the African society is A sense of the common good which is a core of shared values is the underlying presupposition of African social morality A humanistic morality whose central focus is the concern for the welfare and interest of each member of community would expectably be a social morality which is enjoined by social life itself Such is the nature of African morality Social life or sociality is natural to the human being because every human being is born into an existing human society A traditional Akan thinker asserted in a previously quoted proverb that says that When a human being descends from the heavens he or she descends into a human town or a human society The point of the maxim is that the human being is social by nature This view finds a variant in Aristotle s celebrated dictum that The human being is by nature a social animal that is that a human being is by nature a member of a polis a human community The word politikon used in Aristotle s dictum means social rather than political Being a member of the human community by nature the individual is naturally related or oriented toward other persons and must have relationships with them The natural sociality or relationality of human beings would and should prescribe a social ethic rather than the ethic of individualism Individualistic ethics that focuses on the welfare and interests of the individual is hardly regarded in African moral thought African social ethic is expressed in many maxims or proverbs that emphasize the importance of the values of mutual helpfulness collective responsibility cooperation interdependence and reciprocal obligations Let me refer to a few of these from the Akan repertoire The point of this proverb is not that a person should always look to another or others for his well being and the attainment of his goals but that there are occasions when the demonstration by another person or other persons of goodwill sympathy compassion and the willingness to help can be a great boost to a person s attempts to achieve his goals to fulfill his life The dependency noted in the foregoing proverb is to be put down to the limited nature of the possibilities of the human individual Human limitations are in fact expressed in the following Akan proverb The proverb points up the inadequacies of the human being that make it impossible for him to fulfill his life socially economically emotionally psychologically and so on It is evidently true that in the context of the society in terms of functioning or flourishing in a human society the human individual is not sufficient for her capacities talents and dispositions are not adequate for the realization of her potential and basic needs It is only through cooperation with other human beings that the needs and goals of the individual can be fulfilled With his self sufficiency whittled away by man s natural condition the individual requires the succor and relationships of others in order to satisfy his basic needs A social ethic that recognizes the importance of the values of mutual help goodwill and reciprocity is the kind of ethic that will counter the lack of human self sufficiency in respect of talents and capacities and in many ways help realize his basic needs Reciprocity and interdependence are forthrightly expressed in the following Akan maxims That the left arm cannot wash itself is of course a matter of everyday experience It is when the two arms wash each other that both become clean thus the need for interdependence The Akan word nnoboa means helping each other to work on the farm In the farming communities of rural Ghana when a farmer realizes that work on the farm cannot be completed within a certain time if he did it single handedly he would request the assistance and support of other farmers in the community The other farmers would readily lend a helping hand to that farmer who would in this way achieve his productivity goals and do so on time The same request would when necessary be made by the other farmers on different occasions It is this kind of experience that led an Akan traditional thinker to create this proverb which because of the word life obra has been made to cover other spheres of the human life than the purely economic or agricultural Refusing to offer help to others and consistently seeking one s own good and disregarding the good of others will result in one s being denied the help and goodwill that may be necessary to achieve certain ends Since you refused to help someone who needed your help or someone who was in distress you are likely to meet the same refusal or denial when you need some help perhaps more help at that The morality of a shared life as in any community thus demands mutuality or reciprocity as a moral mandate in a world in which human beings weak and limited in many ways are subject to vulnerable situations Mutual aid then becomes a moral obligation That a human being due to her limitations deserved to be helped is expressed in the following maxim The Akan word translated needs is hia which as used in this maxim has a normative connotation thus it does more than simply expressing a fact about human life or the human condition The real meaning of the maxim then is that a human being deserves and therefore ought to be helped It also means that a human being must be regarded as an object of moral concern and should therefore be entitled to help by others in the appropriate circumstances The reason why you should help someone in need is also given in the following maxim among others Two important things about this maxim need to be pointed out One is that the maxim is uttered in references only to the pitiable miserable or unfortunate situation of another person referred to in the maxim as your neighbor wo yonko or other people your neighbors These unfortunate situations or circumstances insistently call for the demonstration of sympathy compassion and willingness to offer some help The other important thing about this maxim is that the word neighbor in the maxim does not necessarily refer to the person next door or in one s community but to any other person in your community and beyond even in far off places The basic or ultimate thrust of the maxim is that you should not show insensitivity to people who are in pitiable situations for one day you might be in that situation too and would need the help of others thus your neighbor s situation is potentially your situation every other person is basically you Social morality thus demands mutual reciprocity as a moral mandate in a world in which human beings can easily be overcome even overwhelmed by the contingencies of the human condition and existence Altruism is thus a fundamental moral value Insensitivity to the needs and hardships or suffering situations of others is repudiated in Akan morality as it is indeed repudiated in the moralities of all human cultures In Akan moral thought and practice a maxim that rebukes the lack of feeling for others is put thus Sticking into your neighbor s flesh or body is another way of referring to the suffering misfortune hardship or pain of another person When something such as a needle sticks into your own flesh or body you feel the pain If it stuck into another person s your neighbor s flesh you would not directly feel the pain Even so you should not feel insensitive to the pain or suffering of that person and shrug off your moral shoulders for the other person s body is certainly not a piece of wood that cannot feel pain The foregoing maxims and many others similar to them in content and purpose all underline a social morality There are many African folktales whose conclusions are intended to affirm the values of social morality the kind of morality that is centered on human relations The social character of morality requires that the individual member of the society ever mindful of his interests adjust those interests to the interests and needs of others This requires him to give due consideration to the interests and welfare of others Necessarily embedded in a human community the individual person has a dual moral responsibility for him or herself as an individual and for others as co members of the community with whom she shares certain basic needs and interests African ethics is a humanitarian ethics the kind of ethics that places a great deal of emphasis on human welfare The concern for human welfare may be said to constitute the hub of the African axiological wheel This orientation of African ethics takes its impulse undoubtedly from the humanistic outlook that characterizes traditional African life and thought Humanism the doctrine that sees human needs and interests as fundamental thus constitutes the foundation of African ethics see section above Now the natural sociality or relationality of the human being that would prescribe social ethic see preceding section would also prescribe the ethic of duty or responsibility The natural relationality of the individual immediately involves one in some social and moral roles in the form of obligations commitments and duties or responsibilities to other members of his or her community which the individual must fulfill Social or community life itself a robust feature of the African communitarian society mandates a morality that clearly is weighted on duty to others and to the community it constitutes the foundation for moral responsibilities and obligations There appears to be a conceptual tie perhaps also a practical tie between the social ethic prescribed by the communitarian ethos and the ethic of duty mandated by the same ethos A morality of duty is one that requires each individual to demonstrate concern for the interests of others The ethical values of compassion solidarity reciprocity cooperation interdependence and social well being which are counted among the principles of the communitarian morality primarily impose duties on the individual with respect to the community and its members All these considerations elevate the notion of duties to a status similar to that given to the notion of rights in Western ethics African ethics does not give short shrift to rights as such nevertheless it does not give obsessional or blinkered emphasis on rights In this morality duties trump rights not the other way around as it is in the moral systems of Western societies The attitude to or performance of duties is induced by a consciousness of needs rather than of rights In other words people fulfill and ought to fulfill duties to others not because of the rights of these others but because of their needs and welfare It would be clear from the foregoing discussion that African ethics takes a stand that would be against what are referred to as acts of supererogation A supererogatory act is defined as an act that is said to be beyond the call of duty it is an act that is said to be over and above what a person is required to do as a moral agent In much of the literature on Western moral philosophy an act of supererogation is held not as a strictly moral duty Thus it is neither morally obligatory nor forbidden therefore it is not wrong so the argument concludes to omit or neglect performing it even though it is good and commendable by virtue of its value and consequences on others if it is performed It is supposed to be a meritorious act and yet optional one that may be performed if the spirit moves you but need not be performed Thus a distinction is made in Western literature between moral duty and a supererogatory act the former considered obligatory and moral duty proper and the latter nonobligatory and optional not being a proper moral duty Supererogationism is clearly an oxymoron for why should an act that is good and morally commendable and will conduce to the well being of another person or other persons fail to exact obligation or compel performance We would normally think that there is a moral connection between good and ought and that therefore a morally good act ought to be performed if an act is morally good then it ought to be performed African morality which is humanitarian social and duty oriented rather than rights oriented morality does not make a distinction between a moral duty and a supererogatory duty one that is beyond the call of duty and so does not have to be performed In the light of our common humanity it would not be appropriate in fact it would demean our humanity to place limits to our moral duties or responsibilities Even though it is true that as human beings we are limited in many ways and so are not capable of fulfilling our moral duties to all human beings at all times as such nevertheless the scope of our moral duties should not be circumscribed African humanitarian ethics would seek to collapse moral duty and moral ideals the latter being the basis of the so called supererogatory duty into one capacious moral universe inhabited both by the morality of duty proper obligation and justice and the morality of love virtue compassion benevolence and other moral ideals Such a capacious morality would make no distinction between a morally obligatory act and a morally optional act It would insist that no act that is morally good in itself or that will conduce to the well being of some individual or group of individuals should be considered morally optional to be morally shrugged off or unconscionably set aside if we understand morality to be something that serves or should serve human needs Thus as the second part of a previous quotation says Thus African ethics an ethics that is weighted on duty not on rights would in principle not consider moral duty of any kind as extraordinary optional or supererogatory The African humanitarian ethic makes all people objects of moral concern implying that our moral sensitivities should be extended to all people irrespective of their cultures or societies African morality is founded on humanism the doctrine that considers human interests and welfare as basic to the thought and action of the people It is this doctrine as understood in African moral thought that has given rise to the communitarian ethos of the African society For ensuring the welfare and interests of each member of society can hardly be accomplished outside the communitarian society The communitarian ethos is also borne of beliefs about the natural sociality of the human being expressed for instance in the Akan maxim previously referred to that says that when a human being descends from the heavens he descends into a human town onipa firi soro besi a obesi onipa kurom Social or community life is thus not optional to the human being Social life which follows upon our natural sociality implicates the individual in a web of moral obligations commitments and duties to be fulfilled in pursuit of the common good or the general welfare Thus African humanitarian ethics spawns social morality the morality of the common good and the morality of duty that is so comprehensive as to bring within its compass what are referred to as moral ideals such as love virtue compassion which are considered supererogatory in Western ethics But central or basic to the African morality is character for the success of the moral life is held to be a function of the quality of an individual s personal life A moral conception of personhood is held in African ethics the conception that there are certain basic moral norms and ideals to which the conduct of the individual human being if he is a person ought to conform The recognition in the African ethical traditions of all human beings as brothers by reason of our common humanity is indeed a lofty moral ideal that must be cherished and made a vital or robust feature of global ethics in our contemporary world It is a bulwark against developing bigoted attitudes toward peoples of different cultures or skin colors who are also members of the universal human family called race Please contact the author with suggestions Africana Philosophy Akan

Edmund Burke author of Reflections on the Revolution in France is known to a worldwide public as a classic political thinker it is less well understood that his intellectual achievement depended upon his understanding of philosophy and use of it in the practical writings and speeches by which he is chiefly known The present essay explores the character and significance of the use of philosophy in his political thought That thought is of the very first importance for intellectual history and for the conduct of politics This essay is the first attempt to examine its philosophical character and to connect the latter with Burke s political activity In doing so it shows the importance of the philosophical elements in Burke s thought and how these contribute important ways to his political thought The name of Edmund Burke is not one that often figures in the history of philosophy This is a curious fate for a writer of genius who was also the author of a book entitled A Philosophical Enquiry Besides the Enquiry Burke s writings and some of his speeches contain strongly philosophical elements philosophical both in our contemporary sense and in the eighteenth century sense especially philosophical history These elements play a fundamental role within his work and help us to understand why Burke is a political classic His writings and speeches therefore merit attention as examples of attention to both ideas and to history and of the role of this attention in practical thought His work is also as we see shall see at the end of this entry an achievement that challenges assumptions held by many of our contemporaries One way or another then Burke is a vitally important figure Yet there is very little academic writing about Burke and philosophy outside of that Enquiry This is a significant omission from the history of political thought for at least three reasons One is that though much has been written about Burke including work placing him in relation to other political writers yet how he thought has not been made clear A second is that the rational content of his thinking has not been made evident precisely because its philosophical component has not been identified Thirdly because the manner and content of his thought have not been identified in the way the case warrants we read of Burke s mystic spirit Spurgeon p or the irrationalism of his writing Butler p This matters not only with respect to historical truth important though that is but also because Burke continues to be treated as a symbolic or instructive figure for contemporary political action cf e g Norman Stephens and in significant ways marks an instructive contrast with some current ways of thinking This being so it is especially important to understand the historical figure and importantly the general elements in his thought including the philosophical ones Burke was born at Dublin in Ireland then part of the British Empire the son of a prosperous attorney and after an early education at home became a boarder at the school run by Abraham Shackleton a Quaker from Yorkshire at Ballitore in County Kildare Burke received his university education at Trinity College Dublin a bastion of the Anglican Church of Ireland Thence he proceeded to the Middle Temple at London in order to qualify for the Bar but legal practice was less attractive to him than the broader perspective which had captured his attention at university or earlier It was first as a writer and then as a public figure that he made his career Burke s intellectual formation did not suggest that his career would be purely philosophical Indeed for those without an independent income or a clerical vocation such a way of life was not very feasible in Britain or Ireland Only the Scottish universities offered many posts that did not require holy orders but they were not very receptive to non presbyterians Burke married in and had a son by so that a career of Humean celibacy in which philosophy was cultivated on a little oatmeal was not for him Burke like Hume found that there was more money in narrative works and in practical affairs than in philosophy Burke s earliest writings include A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful and A Vindication of Natural Society Thereafter he was co author of An Account of the European Settlements and began An Abridgement of English History c From at least until he was the principal conductor of the new Annual Register In Burke became private secretary to the Marquis of Rockingham who had just become First Lord of the Treasury i e the chief minister of the Crown in Great Britain and Ireland and was elected to the British House of Commons in the same year He remained there with a brief intermission in the Autumn of for nearly twenty nine years retiring in the Summer of Burke who was always a prominent figure there and sometimes an effective persuader gave a great many parliamentary speeches He published versions of some of these notably on American Taxation Conciliation with America and Fox s East India Bill These printed speeches though anchored to specific occasions and certainly intended to have a practical effect in British politics were also meant to embody Burke s thought in a durable form In that respect they parallel his Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents and Reflections on the Revolution in France amongst other non oratorical writings Burke s activity as a parliamentarian and political writer embraced a great many concerns Prominent amongst these were the problems of British rule overseas in North America India and Ireland His name however has been linked most strongly by posterity to a critique of the French Revolution of Burke was certainly more notable as a pundit than an executive politician He held national office only twice for a few months in and His political life was punctuated in May by a break from certain of his party colleagues over the significance of the Revolution Thereafter assisted not least by the turn the Revolution took in he became a largely independent commentator on domestic politics and international affairs in An Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs Letters on a Regicide Peace and A Letter to a Noble Lord Burke in his last years especially from also turned his attention to his native Ireland He failed to found a political dynasty and he left no lasting school in parliamentary politics the last politician who can be regarded plausibly as a disciple the addressee of A Letter to William Elliot died in As Sidgwick observed in the s though Burke lives we meet with no Burkites Sidgwick Nor did Burke bequeath a straightforward legacy to any political party or to any ideological brand of thought though plenty have tried to appropriate him wholly or partly The difficulties that they might encounter in colonising his thought are apparent from an account of it that emphasizes its philosophical aspects Burke s mind by the time he left Trinity had two features of especial interest one was an orientation towards religion improvement and politics the other a philosophical method The latter derived from his university education the former from reflection on the Irish situation Burke was born into an Ireland where reflective intellect had its social setting in a small educational elite much of it connected with the Church of Ireland This elite contemplated a political class which owned much of the land and consisted primarily of a gentry and peerage headed by the King s representative the Lord Lieutenant but it saw too a tiny professional class and a huge illiterate impoverished peasantry The aim of the educational elite which it shared with some of the political class was improvement in the broadest sense that is to say it connected self improvement through the influence of the arts sciences and through the development of intellectual skills with moral culture and with economic development The ability of the educated the politicians and the rich to take constructive initiatives contrasted starkly with the inability of the peasantry to help itself peasants relieved their misery principally through spasms of savagery against their landlords representatives but such violence was repressed sternly and helped nobody For Burke as with some of his contemporaries savagery is a term of art about conduct in particular conduct that falls below certain standards The Irish situation suggested a general rationale of practice to those who wished to improve themselves and others improvement if it was to spread outside the educational elite must spring from the guidance and good will of the possessing classes from the landlord who developed his property from the priest who instructed and consoled the poor and from the lord lieutenant who used his power benevolently The only obvious alternative was the use of force and that was both destructive and fruitless Burke retained all his life a sense of the responsibility of the educated rich and powerful to improve the lot of those whom they directed a sense that existing arrangements were valuable insofar as they were the necessary preconditions for improvement and a strong sense of the importance of educated people as agents for constructive change change which he often contrasted with the use of force whether as method or as result This experiential orientation of Burke s mind was turned from attitude into articulate thought through the educational medium of the Irish Enlightenment For example some points that may seem distinctively Burkean belonged first to Berkeley Berkeley saw no advantages in improper abstraction or in a mythical golden age Burke s unwillingness to judge institutions and practices without first connecting them with other things his disinclination to give praise or blame to any thing which relates to human actions and human concerns on a simple view of the object in all the nakedness and solitude of metaphysical abstraction RRF W S viii is a practical judgement that implies a conceptual counterpart like Berkeley s view that when we attempt to abstract extension and motion from all other qualities and consider them by themselves we presently lose sight of them and run into great extravagancies Berkeley Principles of Human Knowledge vol ii In both cases philosophical wariness matched a distaste for considering aspects of objects in permanent isolation from the other aspects with which they were actually connected This suspicion of abstract ideas accompanied a suspicion of schemes for considering people in abstraction from their present situations and accompanied too doubts about a golden past Berkeley rejected the rude original of society Berkeley The Querist vol vi and had no time for declaimers against prejudice who have wrought themselves into a sort of esteem for savages as a virtuous and unprejudiced people Berkeley Discourse addressed to Magistrates vol vi and it need not be emphasized that Burke shared such views Both belonged to an elite which considered improvement to be necessary and sought to make it through the agencies in church state and education that were really available at the time Above all they shared an intellectual temper they sought to see things how they are with an eye to bettering the condition of society But Burke was not Berkeley and though their similarities indicate a shared philosophical orientation Burke had his own way of developing it To individuate him we must turn to what he acquired from the Trinity syllabus and how he used his acquisitions This syllabus by the time Burke became an undergraduate student in not only gave attention to Aristotelian manuals but also to the way of ideas enshrined in Locke s Essay concerning Human Understanding Such a syllabus in its Aristotelian aspect indicated the unity of all departments of literature or learning as we now call it which was congenial to one with Burke s passion for knowledge he wrote of his furor mathematicus furor logicus furor historicus and furor poeticus It also indicated the range of achievements and the range of needs that people had generated The extent and variety of human activity impressed itself upon Burke If his practical situation in Ireland suggested that not reason alone but also Christianity and persuasion were necessary to improvement Burke could now understand these needs in terms of a scheme of learning and indeed had the opportunity to develop the corresponding skills At Trinity he founded a debating society where he developed his oratorical technique on theological moral and political topics as well as commenting on the economic and literary life of Ireland in a periodical run by himself and his friends This acquisition of skills was complemented by an opportunity for philosophical development This applied in particular to Burke s antecedent bent towards the imaginative branches of literature especially romances of chivalry such as the Faerie Queen by Edmund Spenser the collateral ancestor from whom he derived his Christian name Creations of alternative worlds by the mind now received a philosophical warrant from another part of the Trinity syllabus Locke had recognized that the mind devised complex ideas The mind had a power to receive simple ideas from the senses and from its reflection on its own operations and to make out of this material further ideas that had no referent in the world of sensation Burke s interest in developing such ideas did not extend to the centaurs that Locke had mentioned but the ability to make complex ideas and to assemble them in new ways was central to Burke s way of proceeding His philosophical method involved thinking in terms of complex ideas about a connected range of matters matters connected by their place in a programme of human improvement Reason was fundamental to this method but not reason alone as we see in Burke s sole work devoted wholly to philosophy which made use of Locke s thought on the way to an original destination Locke s Essay concerning Human Understanding of was the first attempt to give a survey of the mind s workings that was both comprehensive and post aristotelian It soon fostered intense interest in epistemology psychology and ethics Burke seems to have worked on the imagination the faculty of devising and combining ideas as an undergraduate and continued to do so into the s The result A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful emphasized unsurprisingly the activity of mind in making ideas and the influence of these upon conduct It was in the first place an exercise in clarifying ideas with an eye to refining the ways in which the arts affect the passions in other words a refinement of complex ideas was taken to be the precondition of a refinement of practice The roots of human activity Burke thought were the passions of curiosity pleasure and pain Curiosity stimulated the activity of mind on all matters Ideas of pain and of pleasure corresponded respectively to self preservation and society and society involved the passions of sympathy imitation and ambition Imitation tended to establish habit and ambition to produce change Sympathy did neither but it did establish an interest in other people s welfare that extended to mental identification with them The scope of sympathy could embrace anyone unlike compassion which applied only to those in a worse situation than oneself Such width of concern had an obvious reference to the social order and may express also Burke s thinking about the theatre The passions understood in Burke s way suggested at once that society as such answered to natural instincts and that it comprised elements of continuity and improvement alike Burke then proceeded to show that self preservation and its cognates suggested the complex idea of the sublime and not least the idea of a God who was both active and terrible Beauty on the other hand comprised a very different set of simple ideas which originated in pleasure Sublime and beautiful therefore sprang from very different origins The diverse views rejected by A Philosophical Enquiry were united by the pervasive assumption that human nature in an unschooled condition as it came from the hand of nature and understood without direct reference to God was in some sense adequate to the human condition Rousseau s Discourse on Inequality was at odds with Burke s view of the naturalness of society and with his view that solitude because unnatural was a source of pain as well as with Burke s position that sympathy rather than merely compassion was a key emotion Burke s view that the mind formed ideas of beauty from the ideas of pleasure it received contradicted the view of Shaftesbury and Hutcheson that beauty like goodness was a perception presented by a sixth or moral sense Burke s further view that our simple ideas of pain went towards a complex idea of a God who inspired terror was very distant from the deists view that He could be understood by our natural faculty of reason alone and that as such He was known to be benevolent and not much besides These three positions alike presumed that human faculties unimproved by human effort and considered with little relation to God were sufficient to inspire right conduct and meet human needs It is not surprising that Burke rejected them Burke not only thought that nature needed improvement but also recognized nature s ambiguity Ambition for instance was the source of enterprise and of improvement but Burke did not suppose that the enterprise produced by this characteristic was in all its manifestations a benefit to its exponent and indeed once called it the cause of the greatest disappointments miseries and misfortunes and sometimes of dangerous immoralities If Burke had a forward looking mind and believed that human nature both required and led to development he did not think that progress was necessarily an unqualified gain for instance in discussing the civilizing of American savages he saw a diminution of their courage as well as an increase in their moral goodness For Burke savagery contrasts with civilisation and unlike some other figures he did not suppose that savagery was by definition equivalent to all behaviour of indigenous peoples as such A Philosophical Enquiry suggests that Burke was developing the loyalties of his youth through the medium of philosophical psychology A God who presents Himself through nature in a way that is often found in the Bible and who devises and sustains nature in a way that leads people to society and facilitates the improvement of that society has set Himself to support Christianity power and improvement and very probably education too At the same time however other aspects of the book suggest that this support was delivered to them not on their own terms but on the terms of a philosophy which recognizes the ability of the imagination to transform people s understandings of themselves and their society Anyone who thinks in terms of complex ideas can see that these can be framed easily in different ways none of which need correspond to anything found in the external world combine the ideas of a man and a horse as Locke had suggested and you have the idea of a centaur No one who reads romances as the young Burke had done would find difficulty in imagining a society differing beyond recognition from its current arrangements A classic instance of political imagination indeed is Burke s own Vindication of Natural Society which presents as an alternative model of society an organization if that is the word devoid of civil government church and significant private property Burke in other words had a conception of ideas that enabled him to think through not only his own grouping of claims but also their opposites This reflects no doubt other features of his mind apart from his understanding of complex ideas such as the skill in seeing the strong side and the weak side of any argument which Burke had acquired in his undergraduate study of rhetoric and it reflects too a habit of versatility begun in his debating society for there speakers were called upon to play roles and no doubt it is reminiscent again of Burke s undergraduate interest in the theatre Yet beyond all of these it suggests that in the large topics which experience had put before Burke religion morals arts and sciences argument had not produced overwhelmingly decisive results to his way of thinking For A Vindication also seems to make a case against everything he had espoused If argument did not deliver incontestable conclusions where was one to go Burke s answer in his notes was that where this was so people should prefer the conclusions that accorded with their natural feelings The complement to this emphasis upon feeling was to look to the results of affective preference that is to say a criterion for conduct in such a case was what tended to make people better and happier This was a judgement in the first place about personal conduct and the manner of applying it to matters on the larger scale of civil society was less obvious Here the judgement of benefit whether ethical or pleasurable might be harder to discern In order to make it plain in A Vindication Burke applied a reductio ad absurdum to principles in theology that he had rejected by showing their consequences for politics For that is what A Vindication provided This short work was written in the persona of the recently deceased Henry St John Viscount Bolingbroke Bolingbroke had been a Tory pillar of the state and therefore of the church too but the posthumous publication of his philosophical works revealed that far from being an Anglican he had not been a Christian but rather a deist A Vindication suggested the ills that Bolingbroke had attributed to the artifice of revealed religion could be paralleled by those generated by civil society One logic indeed was attributable on these terms to both Christianity and civil society that just as the latter distributed the means of power unequally so too did Christianity distribute those of salvation unequally for not everyone had heard and fewer believed the Gospel The deism of Bolingbroke implied the principle that God treated everyone impartially and that the means to salvation were therefore to be found in a medium available to all and thus available from the earliest point of human history namely reason It was easy to add as Burke did that if the principle that such an original nature was the mature expression of God s ordinances were to be applied to civil society the normative result would be a regression from complex and therefore civilised forms to a simple society even to animal like primitiveness some of the matter of A Vindication paraphrases Rousseau s Discourse on Inequality Sewell So Bolingbroke the deist and Bolingbroke the politician could be made to look very much at odds with each other This gap offered Burke an opening A Vindication satirized Bolingbroke s schizophrenic position employing a good deal of transparent exaggeration to make his criticisms of civil artificial society seem very absurd and Burke added a preface to the second edition which made the disjunctive alternatives clear so that even he who ran might read Yet it is hard not to recognize that Burke himself was telling the reader in a way that entered the consciousness all the more forcibly because it accompanied entertainment that civil society really did involve some evils just as he identified losses as well as gains from progress in other connexions Burke s Vindication speaking in the voice of pseudo Bolingbroke lamented the situation of miners and the innumerable servile degrading unseemly unmanly and often most unwholesome and pestiferous occupations of so many wretches was lamented by Burke without any such persona thirty four years later in Reflections on the Revolution in France Such criticism taken in itself is undoubtedly telling Burke never dissembled the existence of the real misery that he observed in civil society Instead he pointed out that wretched practices could not be detached from the larger pattern of habits and institution in which they were implicated and that this pattern had a beneficial effect overall Burke recognized misery did not deny it and therefore had a lively sense of the imperfection of arrangements however civilized they might be His sense of duality in nature and society resembles Adam Smith s Burke s position therefore was poised But it was not merely a matter of pointing out what made for good and what for ill in civil society it was a matter of responsibility of choosing morally appropriate words This was so for a philosophical reason because of the very nature of the words involved Burke s Philosophical Enquiry divided words into three categories First there were aggregate words which signified groups of simple ideas united by nature e g man horse or tree Second there were simple abstract words each of which stood for one simple idea involved in such unities as red blue round or square Thirdly and most importantly for our purpose came abstract compound words These united aggregate words and simple abstract words As such they need not have a referent that existed in nature A Philosophical Enquiry argued that no compound abstract nouns suggested ideas to the mind at all readily and that in many cases they did not correspond to any idea at all but instead produced in the mind only images of past experience connected with these words This category included virtue vice justice honour and liberty besides magistrate docility and persuasion Wecter The centrality of such terms to a discussion of civil society requires no emphasis The obvious inference from Burke s philosophy of language was that to use abstract compound words was less to discuss ideas than to raise images which touched the affections of the listener or reader To do this could scarcely to be thought part of a speculative activity the effect would not be cognitive but practical not to develop ideas but to influence conduct The question was with what arrangements were these words and therefore pleasurable images to be connected This understanding of the mind gave speakers and writers an unusually powerful role It was in their hands to connect words which suggested pro attitudes with arrangements of their choosing for these words had did not imply only one set of conceptual contents because they implied none If one recollects the propensity to imitation that Burke found in mankind this choosing was likely also to be leading So Burke was exceptionally sensitive to the role of men of letters and public speakers in moulding opinion By the same measure he had an unusually lively sense of their responsibilities It was they who had the power to guide people to the proper ends or elsewhere Guidance need not be directly didactic indeed it could not be because there could be no definitions to expound but would be a matter of providing a linguistic setting which guided listeners and readers to goals that were ethically and politically beneficial One crucial approach that Burke himself developed was historiographical In works of history or in oratory discussion involving a compound abstract noun such as civilization or liberty could take place in connexion with aggregate words like Indians or the English and therefore being discussed in relation to these connected that noun with definite ideas rather than with further ideas that had no easily identifiable content or no content at all Almost all of Burke s writings and his more important speeches have a strong historical element That element is cast as a narrative in a way that connects compound abstract words with specific persons and specific transactions Burke also wrote avowedly historical works in the years immediately after publishing A Philosophical Enquiry The content of these histories developed the preferences of his youth for improvement by embodying these in a way that made them integral to the origins and continuing character of modern arrangements in the Americas and in England Burke like Smith again wrote philosophical history that is to say gave a view of the key agencies that had shaped human destiny over the long run of human society Indeed he casually implied a four stage theory of socio economic history at a time when Scottish stadial history except that in Dalrymple s Feudal Property was either unwritten or unpublished But his attention primarily lay elsewhere as appears in An Account of the European Settlements This work arose from the initiative of booksellers alive to the reading public s interest in North America where Britain was then at war with France and the work was co written with Burke s cousin and friend William Burke Edmund s pen is evident in the passages which contrast savagery with civilization The book emphasized that the coming of Europeans to the New World brought with it a civilizing of savages who were far from noble through the agency of institutionalised Christianity This implicit distance from the contemporary cult of the noble savage and from primitivism in general provided an identifiable complement to the implied rejections of A Philosophical Enquiry and the satire about natural society in A Vindication A stage of human history rather later than that of savages was delineated within An Abridgement of English History which Burke wrote after but did not finish So far as it goes this provided a continuous account that ran from the Roman landings to Magna Carta Christianity figured again in this narrative as a source of civilization but the significance of the tale was more complex This time the story was primarily political and showed how one of the values most prized by Burke s contemporaries civil liberty came to belong to England The Norman Conquest of England established a powerful executive government and brought with it a uniform system of law if these two were necessary conditions for the matching grace of civil liberty for all however they were not sufficient the required addition came from an aristocracy which had been taught the value of liberty by the Archbishop of Canterbury and which had come to understand that its own power was insufficient to extract the requisite concessions from the crown unless popular support could be won Burke s sense of the double edged character of civilization thus developed into a sense that the political regime required by an advanced society the combination of strong institutions with civil liberty came from sources that were contrary to each other and not always beneficial in isolation aristocracy as a form of government was an austere and insolent domination TCD W S ii and as both a strong executive and civil liberty were needed by the same token the forces making for each needed to be counterbalanced from the other side on a continuing basis This balance of forces characterised a situation in which liberty had an identifiable content namely the specific civil liberties secured through political struggle and written into Magna Carta Burke s narratives suggested that agencies antipathetic to each other if properly connected to one another might produce results that were both intelligible and valuable One effect amongst several of this conception of cooperative conflict was a rehabilitation of the Roman Catholicism that was the historic heritage of Burke s family An Account and An Abridgement alike suggested that in its historical time and place Roman Catholicism and indeed clericalism whether embodied in Jesuit missionaries or in an English archbishop had been a constituent needed to produce social and political benefits of a fundamental kind As an historiographical exemplar An Abridgement therefore showed an exceptional appreciation of the Middle Ages which was to induce raptures in Lord Acton It anticipated both Richard Hurd s Letters on Chivalry and Romance and still more a great work that set the bearings for Anglo American medievalists for many years William Stubbs Constitutional History of England Burke however could not think in terms of an academic historiography still less one that could be the exclusive intellectual preoccupation of its exponents neither of these existed in his time He could think however of quietly defusing anti Roman prejudice in Georgian Britain Burke himself was not a Roman Catholic and viewed enquiry into his personal background with alarm and suspicion This was sensible enough in a Britain which still subliminally linked civil liberty with Protestantism and therefore regarded Irishness as a likely pointer to popish subversion of its political values Burke s argumentative stance always benefited Roman Catholics but he never found a kind word for the Pope his was a position which emphasized the priority of civil interests over denominational claims in civil society Indeed Burke considered that the truth of our common Christianity is not so clear as this proposition that all men at least the majority of men in the society ought to enjoy the common advantages of it TPL W S ix This was a political development of the centrality he gave to the claims of improvement and of the obvious necessity of its free development for the bettering of the human condition It also silently defused any papal claim to civil dominance on theological grounds and more audibly suggested that the penalisation of Roman Catholic beliefs was wrong if these did not cause Catholics to interfere with others civil interests Burke s presumptions about the priority of civil interests and a sense of the possible irrelevance of denominational opinion to civil society suggest a reading of Locke s Letter concerning Toleration and Two Treatises of Government the latter of which was common though not prescribed reading at Trinity It also implies that the proper terms in which to conceive civil interests are those of natural jurisprudence because there people are considered without reference to any specific allegiances credal or otherwise Burke referred to natural law and natural rights directly when such reference advanced his own arguments though he made no theoretical contribution to natural jurisprudence until quite late in life His creative energies were mostly applied elsewhere Burke developed his thoughts about civil interests in a work that his executors entitled Tracts on the Popery Laws which he drafted when he was employed as private secretary to the Chief Secretary for Ireland in the early seventeen sixties After this Burke became involved more immediately in political practice and by one means or another contributed to it until his death and through the activities of his executors in publishing or reprinting his writings from beyond the grave This was one obvious route for practical development even besides the amenities of status that it brought to Burke For his view of the compound abstract words involved in civil discussion did not suggest that purely speculative study had unlimited potential either for the mind or for personal satisfaction because a strictly speculative discussion was likely to be inconclusive at best such words became more readily intelligible in connexion with the concrete and therefore the practical Hence perhaps Burke concluded that man is made for Speculation and action and when he pursues his nature he succeeds best in both Somerset There was on this understanding intellectual benefit in political participation and equally political practice might benefit from the speculative mind This is likely to seem an implausible position nowadays when political activity is frenetic and learning is a matter of speciality but in the eighteenth century when an agile mind could manage at least the basics of several branches of learning and the British legislature was often in session for less than six months each year it was more plausible Political participation on Burke s understanding besides its intellectual possibilities had an ethical potential To the extent that thinking about politics was necessarily uncertain the proper conduct of affairs depended upon an honest as well as a capacious mind and on a well disposed management of words It remains to show what Burke learnt from political activity and what he conferred upon it The picture is one in which the claims of practice enriched Burke s mind and brought intellectual benefits to practice itself Burke s life was spent in parliamentary affairs from the mid s and this made a difference to his style of intellectual activity This did not lie primarily in developing the cast of his mind and if in Burke stated that I have endeavoured all my life to train my understanding and my temper in the studies and habits of Philosophy at the same time he concluded that my Principles are all settled and arranged This did not preclude intellectual innovation The difference made by participation lay not least in his reasons for applying his mind and consequently in how he did so The reasons were to influence opinion both in Parliament and from his position as a member of the legislative and to determine votes in the House of Commons itself The matter common to both of these was Burke s view that words were central to political understanding An obvious inference from Burke s account of compound abstract words is that to use these is to touch the experience of reader or listener and that persuasion was unavoidably central to discussing politics this befitted a practical rather than a speculative subject Indeed these terms implied that the point of discussing politics must be to influence action and nothing much else Burke developed great skill in managing words begun in debating at Trinity and carried forward at other venues including the House of Commons As such language was persuasive its objective was to establish pro attitudes and con attitudes in mind of listener or reader This was not the only philosophical aspect in Burke s political practice A major conceptual tool in discussing politics was relation Relation is one of those terms which was common to both the scholastics and Locke It denotes both comparison and connexion Comparison was an invaluable procedure because it enabled events institutions and persons to be placed in any number of lights which would raise or lower their significance and standing Connexion was scarcely less valuable because the place that someone or something occupied could be used to sustain or criticise their role as well as to demonstrate the value of co operative contraries Best of all relation in either sense lent itself to a myriad of uses for as LeClerc had remarked in his Logic which Burke had read at Trinity relations were beyond counting sunt autem innumerae relationes Le Clerc pt ch s p Burke s conception of philosophical history was also fundamental to his political practice Every age has its own manners and its politicks dependent upon them TCD W S ii The manners Burke saw around him in England were continuous with those he had seen in the middle ages or projected backwards thither in which a powerful executive government was balanced by other agencies with the effect of securing civil liberty Those agencies most obvious in Burke s time had established the sovereignty of Parliament at the Glorious Revolution implied it in the Bill of Rights exercised it in the Act of Settlement and confirmed it by suppressing the attempts made from to to reassert claims to the throne that Parliament had rejected Burke understood law in this arrangement as the guarantor of interests of the governed because it was law passed and secured by Parliament It was secured in Parliament by the mutual dependence of Commons Lords and King That sovereignty had this public character made the British state a beneficiary of a very high degree of financial credit and this increased the power of Parliament The long slow movement of British history from a conception of the realm understood as royal property to the state conceived as the expression of public will had in Burke s time reached a stage at which this will was expressed through the decisions of Parliament in a manner heavily influenced by the monarch Burke s political activities therefore assumed parliamentary sovereignty If Burke s view of words and relations gave him practical tools and if parliamentary sovereignty provided him with a practical postulate what did he assume was the proper end of sovereignty We have seen that the relation between sovereign and the governed had for a primary purpose the protection of the latter s civil interests This much suggests continuity between Burke the philosopher historian and Burke the political participant But the former might also see that there were complications for the latter One who sees the multiplicity of civil interests and the variety of relations in which they can be considered and the variety of contraries at work will see that to put society at ease with itself may well imply conflict and see that such conflict is hard to avoid he or she will see too that Parliament forms an arena for conducting it in a stylised and moderated way through the representation of interests appropriate to a civilized state of society and even while participating in such a conflict s he might recognizes the necessity of both sides to the result Here opponents may be not only adversaries but also co workers sharing at least some common assumptions about the system within which their lot was cast although separated from others by the role required of them In that situation the question becomes where do you take your place The answer may depend on your own connexions and on how you conceive them Let us turn to how Burke s thinking was informed by his philosophical thinking especially to his use of relation Burke s method for written composition often combined i identification of relations with ii relevant history and iii treatment in language that would attach pro attitudes to one side or the other in a difference of opinion This method is seen for instance in his Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents Its central statement for our purpose is about i relation in the form of connexion that the British constitution had been constructed in a manner that required the connexion in this case the interdependence of the parts of the sovereign in order to achieve mutual control This statement contrasted with ii the historical statement that there was a new system of court politics which involved disconnecting those parts in order to make the monarch independent of the other parts of the political sovereign Burke s history showed the emergence of this new system and illustrated its pernicious results in both domestic and foreign affairs The contrast iii between the older system which was represented as having benign results was clear and the disposition of pro language obvious enough Burke s appeal lay to the standards which his contemporaries would take for granted namely those implied in their beliefs about parliamentary sovereignty As if it were not enough the picture of the older order was reinforced by a sense of connexion in the Aristotelian sense that Burke s society recognized and approved that man was sociable rather than being a solitary beast and above all by the annexation of the key term of connexion to the side of the dispute that Burke favoured All of these considerations suggested the appropriateness of the good combining to counterbalance the efforts of court politicians and so to sustain parliamentary sovereignty and its benefits This illustrates Burke s remarkable ability to combine philosophical method and philosophical history as well as the practical purpose to which he put them forming an understanding of politics which was practical in the very particular sense of calling for activity in one direction to counterbalance forces coming from another It was also practical in relation to advancing very specific interests These considerations were used to situate quite another sense of connexion namely political party and especially the party of Lord Rockingham to which and to whom Burke had attached himself Indeed Present Discontents was read in draft by his party s leading lights before publication On publication the pamphlet was widely understood as a manifesto for this party After publication Present Discontents became a manual from which fledging politicians learnt the rationale of their party and indeed a source book for cat calls from the party colleagues from whom Burke separated in The philosophical and historical element in Burke s positions is evident only to those who retrace all of his steps an activity which his contemporaries lacked the will and as not all of his major works had been published some of the means to do The educative effect of Burke s writing is not to be underestimated in a civil society which boasted many highly literate members but had very few with any formal education in political science except sometimes at Scottish universities Indeed it is likely that Burke wrote in order to educate Yet at the same time that the strength of his ideas and historical arguments and the skill with which he developed these excites the reader s admiration they create unease This is not merely because in Present Discontents the philosophical sense of connexion is used to adumbrate the claims of a party connexion it is a more generalized disquiet A politician inspires confidence in part because s he is taken to be honest and a good way to be thought honest is to convey the impression that you are not clever enough to deceive As a philosopher commands interest when s he is intellectually powerful this impression is one that is hard to achieve but it can be done C D Broad suggested that Locke we feel is not so much cleverer than ourselves as to be capable of playing tricks with us even if he wanted to do so He is the Mr Baldwin of philosophy and he derives from his literary style some of the advantages which that statesman owed to his pipe and his pigs Broad This judgement does not apply to Burke though he did keep pigs The reader carries away from Burke a sense of great creative power dialectical skill and verbal ingenuity in short a sense of being overborne by intellectual force The listener probably received other and unwelcome sensations when these were seconded by personal raucousness Such feelings generate unease and unease is increased by Burke s manner of writing His literary style is to argue clearly and concisely but in doing so to include a manifest carefulness of qualification that will permit subsequent shifts of position for instance his self description as a true but severe friend to monarchy is consistent with his occupying any point within the generous spectrum of parliamentary sovereignty and indeed the sense of historical change which pervades Present Discontents suggests that political movement is a common experience Unease perhaps is increased even further for against one equipped with this intellectual repertoire the accusation of inconsistency is irresistibly tempting and utterly useless Again Burke s is a very sensible way for a statesman to think but it is not how the public wishes politicians to appear on most occasions Still less is it reassuring about Burke s intellectual bona fides for this is not how people innocent of political experience who are always the majority conceive the role of political principles Coleridge put his finger on an important point when he suggested that from principles exactly the same Burke could draw practical inferences almost opposite in different situations Coleridge vol i Burke s philosophical and historical positions are clear but they do not translate and were not meant to translate into a set of specific practical conclusions of permanent validity There was the contrast too between the breadth of view and of learning in the matured statements that Burke published on the one hand and on the other the ways of the parliamentary pugilist who was audible to fellow M P s and legible to others in the speeches reported by the daily newspapers Burke s manner was anything but philosophical as the public understands the word Partly this was doubtless because Burke was like that as a person and not least because he had a weak voice that had to be raised if it was to be heard in the bear garden that was the House of Commons but partly too because his Philosophical Enquiry had suggested that the best way to impart a mood to an audience was to display it oneself So for instance if Burke needed to plead for moderation he did so immoderately Above all perhaps it was because this philosopher turned participant was not exempt from the need to win to his side enough minds to ensure that his side was not beaten or at any rate demonstrated enough strength to remain in contention and had at hand an exceptionally powerful range of persuasive tools It is an evident fact too that the resources of Western civilization were sometimes invoked by Burke in order to produce votes in the House of Commons votes which whatever else they were were in the interests of his party But manifestly these resources do not supply a rationale for only one policy still less for only one party or for voting only one way on a given occasion The roles of thinker and party spokesman consort ill and there were bound to be doubts about one An apparent junction of this sort was always likely to suggest that Burke had profoundly personal motives for narrowing his mind and when he was not being caricatured as an Irish Jesuit he was being satirized as a corrupt hack Yet some sort of procedure of the type pursued by Burke was implied in his sense of practical reasoning The philosopher in action had the function of finding proper means to the proper ends of Government marked out by the speculative philosopher TCD W S ii Parliamentary votes in the situation that Burke found himself were amongst the proper means Political participation generated scepticism about Burke as a person some of which was unjust though all of it was to be expected What was perhaps less predictable and is certainly more interesting philosophically is that this participation was a precondition of the practical thought which made Burke famous in his own time and has given him a leading place in the canon of Western political thought One very important example of this is his treatment of the American Revolution This was informed no doubt by where Burke happened to find himself on the spectrum of practical politics in the years that followed But his conclusions for practice were informed also by his understanding of ideas meaning ideas in a philosophical precisely in a Lockean sense and how these could be combined In other words the content of his political thought was informed importantly not only by where he was practically but also who he was philosophically Burke s practical thinking about the dispute between the British parliament and its North American colonies began with a situation not of his making that is to say the rejection of the Stamp Act by the colonists and its withdrawal by the ministry headed by Lord Rockingham in The Rockingham ministry followed up this concession by way of letting the colonists alone with the explicit assertion of Parliament s right to legislate for the colonies in the Declaratory Act of Burke s task was to demonstrate to the House of Commons the plausibility of this package He did so by combining two complex ideas or at least two abstract compound nouns in a new way One idea was empire which involved command The other was liberty These Burke thought were ideas difficult to combine a sound reflection as they are diametrically opposed but that they were combinable in the further idea of a British empire one which combined legislative command with civil liberty This idea implied letting alone certain matters of concern to the colonists and so allowing them in some respects civil liberty on a de facto basis SDR W S ii This idea is considerably more ingenious than the average British opinion that all the dominions of Great Britain are bound by Acts of Parliament Burke s view was explanatory because it conceived the situation before Parliament in a way that made intelligible the points involved and established a connexion amongst them It was also accommodating because it made the British executive s policy intellectually and therefore practically respectable at the same time that it made room for colonial preferences In short it was a small masterpiece of thinking about policy The repeal of the Stamp Act was followed by the passing of the Declaratory Act Burke was practically successful in with the House of Commons because he was speaking for the executive and a majority amongst Members of Parliament ceteris paribus tended to vote for the king s ministers In and he was practically unsuccessful because he was now in opposition but his conceptual achievement in dealing with the American question became much greater By the issues dividing some American colonists from Parliament had changed The former now resented the attempts of the latter to levy taxation on them directly rather than by the authority of their own colonial legislatures and they resented still more the project of backing the attempt if need be with coercion Burke s speech of on American Taxation did not delete the idea of imperial command but rather elaborated his complex idea of the British empire in a new way in order to deal with the new situation Burke elaborated the complex idea in a way to which complex ideas lend themselves that is to say by adding a qualification of content The sovereignty of the British parliament was an idea that certainly included a right to tax but a right to tax could be understood to be consistent on principle with inaction as well as action The right in plainer language need not be applied Burke could accommodate therefore both the claims of Westminster and those of the colonists To this point of course one might reply that Burke was merely making concessions But observe this situation provided a cue for innovation in an idea Burke inserted a distinction into the idea of sovereignty He distinguished my idea of the constitution of the British Empire from the constitution of Britain unconnected with overseas rule It could be inferred that so that Burke s elaboration of the complex idea of the British empire suggests complementary roles for the British parliament and the colonial legislatures an elaboration which would make the question of taxation irrelevant at a stroke whilst simultaneously emphasizing the authority of Westminster Conceptual refinement provided a practical avenue that other less gifted politicians had not devised Burke s position was altogether subtler than the implied tautology of a minister s claim that to say we have a right to tax America and are never to exercise that right is ridiculous Sir Edward Thurlow quoted in Gore Brown and of another politician s despairing sense that we must either insist upon their submission to the authority of the Legislature or give them up entirely to their own discretion These pundits by failing to conceive a sufficiently complex idea of sovereignty and the sovereign s right to tax failed also to see that sovereignty did not imply an unpleasant choice between abrogating this right by disuse or applying it by force Events soon required a further elaboration of Burke s idea of the British empire The continued use of coercion made the colonists more not less recalcitrant The practical need seemed to be for terms on which they would stay in some sense or senses under British rule Their crucial claim was now that their right to tax themselves by their own legislatures rested on charters from the Crown and that they were subordinate to the Crown alone and not to Parliament Burke gave still closer attention to the idea of sovereignty It would be tactless to emphasize the sovereignty of Parliament but it would be self defeating to withdraw it explicitly and concede a sovereign right over taxation to the colonial legislatures So now in Burke s speech on Conciliation with America he focussed upon only one aspect of the complex idea of a parliamentary sovereign The latter comprised in the British instance not only Lords and Commons but also the king Hence by judicious emphasis the item acquiesced in by the colonists could do some conceptual work my idea of an Empire is that an Empire is the aggregate of many States under one common head whether this head be a monarch or a presiding republick and it was emphasized that the rights of the colonists depended on this superior for the claim of a privilege seems rather ex vi termini to imply a superior power As to a right to tax Burke added on a later occasion that though it was inherent in the supreme power of society taken as an aggregate it did not follow that it must reside in any particular power in that society and therefore Parliament could delegate it to local legislatures In short sovereignty was not in its nature an idea of abstract unity but was capable of great complexity and infinite modifications SSC W S iii Whether Burke s infinite modifications would have assisted in keeping the thirteen colonies within the fold of the British empire is unknowable For nothing like his proposals was tried until which was too late It is clear however that Burke s ability to make changes in ideas depended on his philosophical thinking To think in terms of complex ideas is to recognize that they can be elaborated by adding further ideas to distinguish between the roles of Parliament is to make that addition and to analyse the powers of a parliamentary sovereign as a preface to relocating one of them is to use philosophy as a tool in practical reasoning It is noteworthy also that these philosophical exercises were the means of coping as Burke hoped with practical changes Neither was his work here primarily ideological for though Burke had a practical goal in view and at that one consistent with the Rockingham achievements of he worked philosophically to modify the conceptions in terms of which his contemporaries viewed their situation rather than using his philosophical tools as ways of defending those conceptions without modifying them Thus he added ideas to the stock of his day It is fitting though Burke s proposals were not implemented in time and though his goal was not attained that his American speeches figured prominently in the schools and universities of both the U K and the U S A well into the twentieth century Burke after all was suspicious of poor ideas he concluded that one of the main causes of our present troubles was general discourses and vague sentiments and urged instead study of an exact detail of particulars SSC W S iii Burke s thinking about America also suggests a political disposition that owed something to his philosophical conceptions Burke s complaint in American Taxation against ministers was that they have taken things without any regard to their relations or dependencies and had no one connected view This was in part a straightforwardly cognitive position on which Burke laid an emphasis with prudential point the world with which politicians dealt was complex and to use ideas which were insufficiently complex to capture its contents and their relations was a short way to meet the rough side of reality It was also implicitly an ethical position governments ought not to apply force to existing relations at least those that were legitimate This is in one way an obvious point from natural jurisprudence and one that Burke had made transparently with respect to inroads by the government of Ireland against Catholic property In another and more interesting way it reflected his view that abstract compound nouns and complex ideas evoke specific past experiences To interfere forcibly with someone s experientially based expectations would be to break their mental association between experience and idea or word and so the idea or the word would become meaningless and cease to influence action If therefore my hold of the Colonies is in the close affection which grows from common names amongst other sources that were though light as air as strong as links of iron then let the Colonies always keep the idea of their civil rights associated with your Government they will cling and grapple to you But let it be once understood that your Government may be one thing and their Privileges another that these two things may exist without any mutual relation the cement is gone the cohesion is loosened and every thing hastens to decay and dissolution CWA W S iii To break such mental associations was to break communities This point suggested that a genuinely prudent conduct of affairs would proceed without assaulting the mental associations of the governed and as change was omnipresent would conduct its share under accepted names in other words by gradual and by moderate reform of institutions and practices rather than by immediate and total replacement which Burke stigmatised as innovation This indeed was what Burke claimed to be doing in his contributions of to the recasting of the royal household The intellectual counterpart of this prudent conduct namely the refinement of our existing ideas rather than replacing them is what he had done in his revisions of the idea of sovereignty This style of thinking gave Burke a very lively sense of the corrosive power of new ideas Even new questions could have unpleasant results When the innovations made by the British government unsettled the colonists then they questioned all the parts of your legislative power and by the battery of such questions have shaken the solid structure of this Empire to its deepest foundations The proper way to avoid such shakes to civil society was to consult and follow your experience ATX W S ii for experience according to Burke s philosophy of language was a condition of continuity of mind and on the basis of mind of a sustainable practice His was therefore a philosophically conditioned attitude to practice and one that was very sensitive to the hiatus that speculation could cause in the latter Burke s sensitivity can produce apodictic language in order to persuade people to make use of the ideas they have inherited by urging a total renunciation of every speculation of my own and by recommending a profound reverence for the wisdom of our ancestors CWA W S iii Indeed Burke can be found sometimes deprecating on such rational grounds all explicit appeal to speculation of any complexion or hue if it had a disturbing effect reason not at all oppose the ancient policy and practice of the empire as a rampart against the speculations of innovators on both sides of the question italics added ATX W S ii His deprecation of speculation was logically anterior to taking sides in politics It was also in effect an appeal for ideas adequate to governing This is evident in Burke s criticism of vulgar and mechanical politicians so that little minds could not govern a great empire CWA W S iii or evidently any empire at all whereas better results might be expected from men truly initiated and rightly taught Burke himself however much he might try to set the logic of his thought and his intellectual inventiveness within a rich foliage of words generated by his skill with the English language he is perhaps the only classic of political thought in the English language who is also a literary classic was a philosophical thinker As such his practical conclusions could change and did as we have seen Practical conclusions changed because they were meant to be serviceable in a world that itself was changing Burke s philosophical equipment however served him in the face of all external changes The most dramatic of such changes came during the last eight years of his life with the advent of the French Revolution of and its continuation in varying forms down to Burke s name is indissolubly connected to his Reflections on the Revolution in France If Reflections was not the first criticism of the Revolution of it is the one that has established itself permanently in the public mind as the most incisive one and it is unlikely to be displaced This is a curious fact in a way If we turn to Burke s other writings of the s a more perceptive account of the causes of the Revolution of is to be found in A Letter to William Elliot Again Letters on a Regicide Peace investigate the character and consequences of the Revolution from in a more thoroughgoing way than Reflections had provided for the years and Yet in an important sense the judgement of posterity is right for our purposes Reflections illustrates very clearly the central importance of philosophy and philosophical history for Burke s writing about one of the greatest changes of his day very soon after it had begun to take effect This is true in the first place in terms of insight Reflections was published on November less than eighteen months after the storming of the Bastille The intervening period had been characterised by a mixture of popular violence and peaceable if feverish political activity in France as its absolute monarchy gave way to a constitutional monarchy A detached observer would be unsure of the future Whether destruction and violence would predominate or whether an enduring constitutional order would emerge was a question which events had not answered In the event of course the Revolution would be characterised by violence and constitutional development alike at different times but this was as unknowable in as it is obvious in the twenty first century Burke despite the darkness in which contemporary assessment are made was able to judge and to judge very decisively Burke s Reflections may be divided for the author did not provide any formal divisions into two portions of unequal length Both of these are concerned with relations The first portion about two thirds of the text suggests that the French in their enthusiasm for the idea of liberty had failed to understand that liberty was only one amongst a range of benefits all of which were required in mutual connexion for a life under civil government that was civilized in the proper sense The results which flowed from this deficiency of understanding included constitutional arrangements which because they did not reflect an understanding of liberty that was subtle enough to grasp that the liberty of the many was power did not qualify popular sovereignty in a way that would restrain the demos effectively As if an unrestrained populace was not bad enough an understanding of life only in terms of liberty swept away preceding elaborations of our ideas This mattered because the refinement of ideas had been a precondition of refinement of conduct and therefore of the progress of society in many respects One key instance of these was the respectful treatment of women encouraged since the middle ages by Christian learning and by chivalry But there was a newer philosophy on this scheme of things a king is but a man a queen is but a woman a woman is but an animal and an animal not of the highest order The retrogression of humanity itself to animality was not far ahead in the future with a swinish multitude The result as people would no longer be moved by opinion which had embodied refined ideas would be that they would need to be governed by force Force too was the ultimate destination of the second portion of Reflections This suggested that the idea of equality had been connected only too pervasively with the institutional arrangements of the judiciary the legislative and the executive power and therefore had produced no authority capable of eliciting obedience but only institutionalised feebleness and disorder At the same time the perverse results of equality in fiscal arrangements had caused popular discontent and financial instability The result was a situation which could be controlled only by the force of the military if indeed military order could subsist when soldiers had applied the idea of equality to their calling France it seemed tended towards either disintegration or the rule of force Burke s philosophical repertoire and historical understanding thus provided the structure of Reflections and perhaps more importantly suggested insights into the character of the Revolution The inattention of the revolutionaries to the relations that needed to be comprised in a modern government especially in connexion with liberty was matched by the inappropriateness to a sovereign regime of structuring its institutions around equality rather than around effective command These insights suggested that a mis structuring of the new constitution proceeded from an inadequate philosophical grasp Such misunderstanding was matched by a failure to understand the historical development which had produced the elaboration of ideas about conduct that had underwritten government by opinion and this failure suggested that the Revolution would cause retrogression from this civilized condition towards a less gentle way of proceeding as well as a less effective one In other words Burke s understanding of philosophy and of the history of Europe conceived philosophically provided grounds for making fundamental claims about the Revolution Whether Burke was right in these claims about the Revolution of course is another question and one that can never be answered French readers of Reflections could take its lessons to heart and anyhow events have a way of modifying tendencies independently of intention and interpretation Indeed none of this is to say that Reflections was intended as an academic work or even an accurate factual statement about the Revolution It was calculated to produce a practical result which was to dissuade the British from admiring the Revolution and so to dampen any propensity they might feel to imitate it and thus to protect civilization in Britain In the course of pursuing this goal Burke was willing to satirize the Revolution and its British sympathizers unmercifully in order to make them as unattractive as possible to any sane reader and he matched the satire with a panegyric on British social and political arrangements There is indeed much in Reflections besides the elements that have been emphasized here and indeed much in Burke s later views on the Revolution which is not in Reflections but without those elements neither the book nor Burke s understanding of the Revolution would have been possible It is clear by now that neither mystic spirit nor irrationalism characterise Burke helpfully These examples of academic appraisal might be taken as extreme At the same time they witness interpretative difficulties Whilst Burke s thought has never lacked interpreters from his own day to ours on the whole they have not brought to bear the combined persistence of historical insight and strength of conceptual grasp required to do justice to him Hence he has suffered an ironic fate for one who urged breadth and precision of thought That is to say he has figured as the spokesman for a very limited number of points or as one preoccupied with a limited number of themes This type of treatment began in the nineteenth century when Burke was invoked as an antidote to the confidence of the French Revolution by liberal thinkers who prized its principles saw their narrowness and required a sense of historical development to situate them properly in a viable civil society It was continued when Matthew Arnold tried to treat Burke as a pre Home Rule Gladstonian spokesman about Ireland It went further still in the twentieth century when Burke was pressed into service as a counter revolutionary agent in the anti Communist cause and when the twenty first dawned some were treating Burke as a proponent of postmodernism He himself could hardly have complained that his work has been put to practical use but it remains true that academic justice has yet to be done to him Chapters and essays on individual themes in his writings have been more plausible on the whole than attempts at general interpretation which usually concentrate on a theme or themes of choice or subordinate Burke s thought to it or them and so give the impression deliberately or otherwise that this is the whole of Burke or at any rate that this is what matters about him One response to this situation is to concentrate primarily on telling the story and it is interesting that a number of recent works have taken this path In attacking the Revolution in France Burke constructed a rogues gallery for French politicians and stocked it also with quite a number of French thinkers The figures who appeared to be rogues however were most of them only straw men stuffed according to the prejudices of a British audience More significantly for our purposes Burke s censure of the philosophes attributed to them complicity with the style of thought that had set up a limited range of simple principles as the norm for politics and which was wholly inadequate to understand and satisfy the connected and various needs of human nature under modern conditions Burke preferred to emphasize that numerous principles and practical thinking to combine them were necessary to meet these needs and so to sustain improvement and to emphasize too that such accommodation involved much more practical activity than speculative design Correspondingly his own writings develop not a political philosophy but rather a political style that had at its core philosophical elements This was a style which implicitly suggested that political philosophy was insufficient to thinking constructively about politics if it was only a speculative sort of knowledge or in other words that it was not a way of thinking sufficient to the task of the philosopher in action The philosopher in action at least as embodied by Burke himself assumed that political philosophy should be highly practical It had for its goal regulating opinion in order to produce good political results and to prevent bad ones It has ever been the great primary object of speculative and doctrinal philosophy to regulate opinion he wrote It is the great object of political philosophy to promote that which is sound and to extirpate what is mischievous and which directly tends to render men bad citizens in the community and mischievous neighbours out of it RP W S ix Such a style of thought emphasises the importance of combining a wide range of principles and of remembering that principles however numerous or important are only one element in a satisfactory conduct of practice There can be no doubt that analysis was involved in Burke s proceedings let this position be analysed he instructed the British House of Commons critically in for analysis is the deadly enemy of all declamation Though Burke could certainly conduct effective analyses of ideas and words even after more than twenty years at Westminster as his Letter to Sir Hercules Langrishe witnesses his accent lay more decidedly upon the necessity of connecting ideas with each other and the inclusion of elements other than one s own ideas in any treatment of politics that aspired to intellectual and practical validity There is nothing in a style of doing philosophy that centres upon analysis that is logically inconsistent with these procedures One temper of mind however which sometimes accompanies this manner of philosophising is antipathetic to Burke whilst there is much in contemporary opinions about politics including those held by at least some analytical philosophers that he would have found dangerously naive Amongst these a belief in a continuing popular sovereignty the modern term of art for this is democracy rather than parliamentary sovereignty is only the most obvious example If Burke is unlikely at present to be the darling of some philosophers and of some pundits still less will he be of those who suppose that in discussing a small number of principles they provide a prescriptive and sufficient guidance for the conduct of policy and even less of anyone who supposes it logically adequate to claim that one very simple principle is entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion and control or to discuss any other matter Mill Introductory The complex character of ideas their connexions with each other the need to understand practice in terms of such relations the importance of continuity in thought and practice and to conduct practice with attention to habitual linkages amongst people s ideas and activities suggest a different sort of thinking So it is not surprising that Burke has been quietly ignored by many recent thinkers or summarily dismissed from consideration by being labelled as a conservative but it is of great interest that he has found and finds many admirers amongst those who succeed in the conduct of practical politics Whilst Burke would have been the first to point out that his specific conclusions belong to a time and a place his intellectual style is one with which any serious thinking about politics whether reflective or practical needs to engage Burke s thought is philosophical in at least two senses One is that it is constituted in part by thinking in terms of philosophical conceptions especially complex ideas particularly those of relation as well as involving significant positions in philosophical psychology and philosophy of language The other sense is that it develops an account of the American British and European past which is philosophical history as the eighteenth century understood the term These senses once put together inform a style of practical thinking about politics which emphasizes the importance of synthetic as well as analytical thinking for practice and suggests that a progressive practice requires not only the yields of past effort but also the intelligent application of mind to their further development if further progress rather than regress is to result Burke is perhaps the least studied of political classics but he is certainly amongst the small number with whom anyone who aspires to have an adequate political education must read and mark very carefully There is no complete edition of Burke s works their quantity the character of some of his manuscript materials and the manner in which many of his parliamentary speeches are preserved all make it very likely that this situation will continue Neither have the editorial problems implied in his writings and speeches been overcome in the selections that have been published For the present there is in nine large substantive volumes Writings and Speeches of Edmund Burke P Langford general editor Oxford Clarendon Press This though not without further problems peculiar to itself does at least provide a standard system reference for most of the items quoted here and is cited above as W S and individual works are cited as follows Note also There is further unprinted correspondence in various repositories The primary collections of Burke manuscripts are at Sheffield City Archives and Northamptonshire Archives both in the United Kingdom but there is further material by Burke in a wider range of places the material in manuscript bearing on him is extremely bulky diverse and scattered There is relatively little recent literature primarily on Burke s philosophical writings however philosophical is defined though there is much that makes reference to or use of them thus a bibliography of writings about his views on beauty gender and political organization as well as his literary temper and practical activities would be disproportionately long The reader is therefore invited to range freely The secondary literature as a whole is listed up to about in Clara I Gandy and Peter J Stanlis Edmund Burke A Bibliography of Secondary Studies to New York Garland There are annual listings in the Modern Humanities Research Association s volumes The Royal Historical Society s Bibliography of British and Irish History has

his Serie A experience to young players in the southeast Chinese coastal county in Fujian Province After a modest playing career in Italy s lower leagues Capriolo then transitioned into coaching working with almost every age group from children to U professionals Now he brings two decades of coaching experience that includes spells in youth academies at Serie A sides Juventus and Torino Since early he has served under program director Marco Marchi in Cagliari Xplay a long term cooperative project between the Italian club and Xiapu County The passion here reminds me of Italy Capriolo observed These kids look at you they try hard and you can see them improving He works alongside year old Ale Taris another Cagliari youth team coach in a comprehensive program that spans eight school teams and directly manages Xiapu No High School s boys and girls teams Their approach mirrors Cagliari s youth training philosophy while adapting to China s educational framework The training model isn t vastly different he explained But we must work within the school schedule This means evening sessions after academic classes finish with afternoons dedicated to analysis and collaboration with local PE teachers The morning is when we prepare training for the next day Capriolo said Ale and I discuss what we observed We work closely with Chinese coaches to ensure everyone understands our objectives This collaborative approach has proved effective in transferring not only skills but also a professional mindset The results spoke for themselves this summer when Taris and Capriolo guided Xiapu s girls team to victory in the Fujian Provincial Youth Football League U championship That experience wasn t just about winning Capriolo reflected The atmosphere was incredible People are crying and celebrating The entire town celebrated together It was a beautiful moment that showed football s power to unite a community Taris who works daily with the girls squad also described the victory as the most unforgettable memory in Xiapu For Capriolo who celebrated his birthday in Xiapu with a surprise party organized by local staff in October the work carries both professional and personal significance I m very happy about this surprise he said It s a very special moment in my life The Xiapu Cagliari partnership which began with a series of summer camps in has evolved into a year round program with Cagliari s football academy establishing its first Chinese branch in Xiapu This year youth team coaches from Cagliari took residence in Xiapu for a three month stay each term The cooperation has continued to deepen with a three year contract having been signed In November eight Xiapu students one boy and seven girls will travel to Italy to train at Cagliari s academy allowing them to experience European football culture In recent years the amateur game has flourished Across provinces like Jiangsu and Guizhou local leagues now pack out community grounds drawing thousands of fans and even catching the eye of international players and media Xiapu offers an alternative model focused on school players and gradual sustainable development especially in small towns Capriolo emphasized patience in his approach We re not looking for overnight superstars If players train with the right mentality improvement is inevitable Asked if he believed a Xiapu student could eventually reach Serie A Capriolo responded with measured optimism Why not With consistent passion proper methods and daily dedication nothing is impossible We re building a pathway As evening fell and another training session began Capriolo watched his students execute drills and passes with increasing precision They need to remember that football is a game he said They should enjoy the sport but always

Stillwell Kolmogorov Yushkevich Boyer Merzbach Wussing Katz Dedekind s more foundational work in mathematics is also widely known Often acknowledged in that connection are his analysis of the notion of continuity his introduction of the real numbers by means of Dedekind cuts his formulation of the Dedekind Peano axioms for the natural numbers his proof of the categoricity of these axioms and his contributions to the early development of set theory Grattan Guinness Ferreir s b Jahnke Corry While many of Dedekind s contributions to mathematics and its foundations are thus common knowledge they are seldom discussed together In particular his foundational writings are often treated separately from his other writings This entry provides a broader and more integrative survey The main focus will be on Dedekind s foundational writings but they will be related to his mathematical work as a whole Indeed it will be argued that foundational concerns are at play throughout so that any attempt to distinguish sharply between his mathematical and his foundational work is artificial and misleading Another goal of the entry is to establish the continuing relevance of his contributions to the philosophy of mathematics Their full significance has only started to be recognized as should become evident This is especially so with respect to methodological and epistemological aspects of Dedekind s approach which ground the logical and metaphysical views that emerge in his writings Richard Dedekind was born in Brunswick Braunschweig a city in northern Germany in Much of his education took place in Brunswick as well where he first attended school and then for two years the local technical university In he transferred to the University of G ttingen a main center for scientific research in Europe Carl Friedrich Gauss one of the greatest mathematicians of all time taught in G ttingen and Dedekind became his last doctoral student He wrote a dissertation under Gauss finished in As was customary he also wrote a second dissertation Habilitation completed in shortly after that of his colleague and friend Bernhard Riemann Dedekind stayed in G ttingen for four more years as an unsalaried lecturer Privatdozent During that time he was strongly influenced by P G L Dirichlet Gauss s successor in G ttingen and by Riemann then a rising star Dedekind did important editorial work for Gauss Dirichlet and Riemann later In he moved to the Polytechnic in Z rich now ETH Z rich Switzerland to take up his first salaried position He returned to Brunswick in where he became professor at the local university and taught until his retirement in He published most of his major works in this later period He also had interactions with important mathematicians elsewhere thus he was in correspondence with Georg Cantor collaborated with Heinrich Weber and developed an intellectual rivalry with Leopold Kronecker He stayed in his hometown until the end of his life in Cf Landau ch of Dugac Scharlau Mehrten ch of Ferreir s Harborth et al Sonar for biographical information Dedekind s main foundational writings are Stetigkeit und irrationale Zahlen and Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen a Equally important especially in the eyes of historians of mathematics is his work in algebraic number theory That work was first presented in an unusual manner as supplements to Dirichlet s Vorlesungen ber Zahlentheorie The latter was based on Dedekind s notes from Dirichlet s lectures edited further by him and published in a series of editions It is in his supplements to the second edition from that Dedekind s famous theory of ideals was first presented He modified and expanded it several times with a fourth edition published in Lejeune Dirichlet Dedekind and an unfinished fifth edition later found in his Nachlass Scheel An intermediate version of Dedekind s theory appeared separately in a French translation Dedekind Further works by him include a long and influential article on the theory of algebraic functions written jointly with Heinrich Weber Dedekind Dedekind Weber and a variety of shorter pieces in algebra number theory complex analysis probability theory etc All of these works were re published together with selections from his Nachlass in Dedekind Finally lecture notes from some of his own classes were made available later Dedekind as were further selections from his Nachlass Dedekind also Dugac Sinaceur Schlimm and from his correspondence Noether Cavaill s Lipschitz Meschkowski Nilson Scheel As this brief chronology indicates Dedekind was a creative and wide ranging mathematician although he tended to publish slowly and deliberately It also shows that he was part of a distinguished tradition in mathematics extending from Gauss and Dirichlet through Riemann Dedekind himself Weber and Cantor in the nineteenth century on to David Hilbert Ernst Zermelo Emmy Noether B L van der Waerden Nicolas Bourbaki and others in the twentieth and twenty first centuries With some partial exceptions these mathematicians did not publish explicitly philosophical treatises At the same time all of them were very sensitive to foundational issues in mathematics understood in a broad sense including the choice of basic concepts the kinds of reasoning to be used and the presuppositions build into them Consequently one can find philosophically pregnant remarks sprinkled through their works including Dedekind s Not much is known about other influences on Dedekind especially philosophical ones While a student in G ttingen he did attend a lecture class by Hermann Lotze called Deutsche Philosophie seit Kant German philosophy since Kant as is clear from notes he took that are preserved in his Nachlass In his short biography of Riemann Dedekind a there is a reference to the post Kantian philosopher and educator J F Herbart professor in G ttingen from to as an influence on Riemann and in his correspondence Dedekind mentions the German Idealist J G Fichte in passing Scharlau Reck However he does not align himself explicitly with either of them nor with any other philosopher or philosophical school Little is known about which philosophical texts might have shaped Dedekind s views especially early on A rare piece of information we have in this connection is that he became aware of Gottlob Frege s most philosophical work Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik published in only after having settled on his own basic ideas similarly for Bernard Bolzano s Paradoxien des Unendlichen Dedekind a preface to the second edition Then again several of Dedekind s mathematical role models had strong philosophical interests especially Gauss Riemann and Cantor Moreover German intellectual life at the time was saturated with discussions of Kantian and German Idealist views including debates about the role of intuition for mathematics There is evidence that Dedekind was familiar with at least some of those discussions The issues addressed in Dedekind s Stetigkeit und irrationale Zahlen Continuity and Irrational Numbers grow out of the rigorization and arithmetization of analysis the mathematical theory in the first half of the nineteenth century Yet their roots go deeper all the way down or historically back to the discovery of incommensurable magnitudes in Ancient Greek geometry e g diagonals in unit squares that have length sqrt Jahnke ch The Greeks response to this startling discovery culminated in Eudoxos theory of ratios and proportionality presented in Chapter V of Euclid s Elements Mueller ch Corry ch This theory brought with it a sharp distinction between discrete multitudes numbers and continuous magnitudes which led to the long dominant view of mathematics as the science of number on the one hand and of magnitude on the other hand Dedekind s first foundational work concerns at bottom the relationship between the two sides of this dichotomy An important part of the dichotomy as traditionally understood was that magnitudes and ratios of them were not thought of as numerical entities with arithmetic operations defined on them but in a more concrete way based on geometry as lengths areas volumes angles etc and as relations between them More particularly while Eudoxos theory provides a contextual criterion for the equality of ratios it does not define the ratios themselves so that they are not conceived of as independent objects Stein Cooke Such features do little harm with respect to basic applications of the theory but they lead to inner mathematical tensions e g when solutions to algebraic equations were considered some of which could be represented numerically others only geometrically This tension came increasingly to the fore in the early modern period especially after Descartes integration of algebra and geometry What was called for then was a unified treatment of discrete and continuous quantities More directly and explicitly Dedekind s essay was tied to the arithmetization of analysis in the nineteenth century pursued by Cauchy Bolzano Weierstrass and others which in turn was a reaction to tensions within the differential and integral calculus introduced earlier by Newton Leibniz and their followers Jahnke chs As is well known the inventors of the calculus appealed to infinitesimal quantities typically backed up by geometric or even mechanical considerations although this was seen as questionable from early on The nineteenth century arithmetizers found a way to avoid infinitesimals in terms of the epsilon delta characterization of limits familiar from current introductions to the calculus Yet this again or even more led to the need for a systematic characterization of various quantities conceived of as numerical entities now in the form of a unified treatment of rational and irrational numbers Dedekind faced this need directly also from a pedagogical perspective when he started teaching classes on the calculus at Z rich in Dedekind preface Given this background the goal for him was not just to supply a unified and rigorous account of rational and irrational numbers he also wanted to do so in a way that established the independence of analysis from mechanics and geometry indeed from intuitive considerations more generally This indicates an underlying philosophical motivation for Dedekind s work on the foundations of analysis beyond the pedagogical needs at issue and it is natural to see an implicit anti Kantian thrust in it Finally the way in which to achieve all of these objectives was to relate arithmetic and analysis closely to each other by reducing the latter to the former While the general idea of reducing analysis to arithmetic as opposed to geometry was not new at the time Dedekind adopted it from his teachers Gauss and Dirichlet Ferreir s ch Merzbach the particular manner in which he proceeded was quite original The crucial issue or the linchpin for him was the notion of continuity To get clearer about that notion he compared the system of rational numbers to the points on a geometric line Once a point of origin a unit length and a direction have been picked for the latter the two systems can be correlated systematically each rational number corresponds in a unique and order preserving way to a point on the line But then a further question arises Does each point on the line correspond to a rational number Crucially this question can be reformulated in terms of Dedekind s idea of cuts defined directly on the rational numbers so that any geometric intuition concerning continuity can be put aside Namely if we divide the whole system of rational numbers into two disjoint parts while preserving their order is each such division determined by a rational number The answer is no since some correspond to irrational numbers e g the cut consisting of x x lt and x x gt which corresponds to sqrt In this explicit purely arithmetic and precise sense the system of rational numbers is not continuous i e not line complete For our purposes several aspects of Dedekind s procedure initially and in later steps are important cf Ferreir s ch To begin with Dedekind starts by considering the system of rational numbers seen as a whole Noteworthy here are two aspects Not only does he accept this system as an actual infinity i e a complete infinite set that is treated as a mathematical object in itself he also considers it structurally as an example of a linearly ordered set closed under addition and multiplication an ordered field In his next step and proceeding further along set theoretic and structuralist lines Dedekind introduces the set of arbitrary cuts on his initial system thus working essentially with the bigger and more complex infinity of all subsets of the rational numbers the full power set It is possible to show that the set of those cuts can in turn be endowed with a linear ordering and with operations of addition and multiplication thus constituting a totally new number system It is not the cuts themselves with which Dedekind wants to work in the end however Instead for each cut those corresponding to rational numbers but especially those corresponding to irrational quantities he creates a new object a real number determined by the cut cf Dedekind b b Those objects together with arithmetic operations and an order relation defined on them in terms of the cuts form the crucial system for him Next two properties of the new system are established The rational numbers can be embedded into it in a way that respects the order and the arithmetic operations a corresponding field homomorphism exists and the system is continuous or line complete with respect to its order What we get overall is the long missing unified criterion of identity for rational and irrational numbers both of which are now treated as elements in an encompassing number system isomorphic to but distinct from the system of cuts Finally Dedekind indicates how explicit rigorous and straightforward proofs of various facts about the real numbers can be given along such lines including ones that had been accepted without proof so far These include basic rules of operation with square roots and the theorem that every increasing bounded sequence of real numbers has a limit value a result equivalent to among others the more well known intermediate value theorem Dedekind s published this account of the real numbers only in fourteen years after developing the basic ideas on which it relies It was not the only account proposed at the time indeed various mathematicians addressed this issue including Weierstrass Thomae M ray Heine Hankel Cantor and somewhat later Frege Dieudonn ch Boyer Merzbach ch Jahnke ch Most familiar among their alternative approaches is Cantor s also published in Instead of using Dedekind cuts Cantor works with equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences of rational numbers The system of such classes of sequences can also be shown to have the desired properties including continuity Like Dedekind Cantor starts with the infinite set of rational numbers his construction again relies essentially on the full power set of the rational numbers here in the form of arbitrary Cauchy sequences and the two resulting systems are isomorphic as is well known In these set theoretic respects the two treatments are thus equivalent What sets apart Dedekind s from Cantor s and all the others is the clarity he achieves with respect to the central notion of continuity cf Haffner Schlimm His treatment is also more elegantly and maturely structuralist in a sense to be spelled out further below Providing an explicit and precise definition of the real numbers constitutes a major step towards completing the arithmetization of analysis But further reflection on Dedekind s procedure and similar ones leads to a new question What is involved in it if thought through fully i e what does this account of the real numbers rely on ultimately As noted Dedekind starts with the system of rational numbers he uses a set theoretic procedure to construct in a central step the new system of cuts out of them and finally the real numbers are created on that basis This leads to three sub questions First how exactly are we to think about the rational numbers in this connection Second can anything further be said about the set theoretic procedures that have been used And third how is the creation at issue to be understood In his published writings Dedekind does not provide an explicit answer to our first sub question What suggests itself from a contemporary point of view is that he relied on the assumption that the rational numbers can be dealt with in terms of the natural numbers together with some set theoretic techniques And in fact in Dedekind s Nachlass explicit sketches of two now familiar constructions can be found that of the integers as equivalence classes of pairs of natural numbers and that of the rational numbers as equivalence classes of pairs of integers Sieg Schlimm earlier Dugac It seems that these constructions were already familiar enough at the time for Dedekind not to feel the need to publish his sketches There is also a parallel to the construction of the complex numbers as pairs of real numbers known to Dedekind from W R Hamilton s works and a more general connection to the use of residue classes in developing modular arithmetic For the former cf Ferreir s ch for the latter Dedekind and Dugac All the material needed for analysis including both the rational and all the real numbers can thus be constructed out of the natural numbers by set theoretic means At this point the question arises Do we have to take the natural numbers themselves as given or can anything further be said about those numbers perhaps by reducing them to something even more fundamental Many mathematicians in the nineteenth century were willing to assume the former A well known example is Leopold Kronecker for whom the natural numbers are given by God while the rest of arithmetic and analysis is made by mankind Ferreir s ch In contrast Dedekind and independently Frege pursued the latter option they attempted to reduce arithmetic and the natural numbers to logic This is the main goal of Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen The Nature and Meaning of Numbers or more literally What are the numbers and what are they for Another goal is to answer the related second sub question above whether more can be said about the set theoretic procedures used For Dedekind again similar to Frege those procedures are part of logic But then what are the basic notions of logic Dedekind s answer to this last question is Basic for logic are the notions of object Ding set or system System and function mapping Abbildung These notions are fundamental for human thought as he emphasizes especially for the notion of function They are logical in the sense of being applicable in all domains indispensable for exact reasoning and not reducible further This interpretation of Dedekind and with it whether he should be understood as a logicist is not uncontroversial Cf Klev Reck and Ferreir s Other Internet Resources on the one hand and Benis Sinaceur on the other hand We will come back to this issue in Section While not analyzable in terms of anything even more basic the fundamental logical notions are nevertheless capable of being elucidated thus of being understood better Part of their elucidation consists in observing what can be done with them including how arithmetic can be reconstructed in terms of them also analysis etc For Dedekind that reconstruction starts again with the consideration of infinite sets but now in a generalized more explicit and more systematic manner Dedekind does not just assume or simply postulate the existence of infinite sets he tries to prove it For that purpose he considers the totality of all things that can be objects of my thought and argues that this set is infinite Dedekind a section v He also does not just presuppose the concept of infinity he defines it in terms of his three basic notions of logic as well as the definable notions of subset union intersection etc The definition is as follows A set of objects is infinite Dedekind infinite as we now say if it can be mapped one to one onto a proper subset of itself A set can then be defined to be finite if it is not infinite in this sense Moving a step closer to arithmetic this leads to the notion of a simple infinity or inductive set A rigorous introduction of that notion involves Dedekind s innovative idea of a chain As one would say in contemporary terminology a chain is the minimal closure of a set A in a set B containing A under a function f on B where being minimal is captured of in terms of the general notion of intersection What it means to be simply infinite can now be captured in four conditions Consider a set S and a subset N of S possibly equal to S N is called simply infinite if there exists a function f on S and an element of N such that i f maps N into itself ii N is the chain minimal closure of in S under f iii is not in the image of N under f and iv f is one to one While at first unfamiliar it is not hard to see that these Dedekindian conditions are a notational variant of Peano s well known axioms for the natural numbers In particular condition ii is a version of the axiom of mathematical induction Those axioms are thus properly called the Dedekind Peano axioms Peano who published his corresponding work in acknowledged Dedekind s priority cf Ferreir s As is also not hard to see any simple infinity will consist of a first element corresponding to a second element corresponding to f a third corresponding to f f and so on just like any model of the Dedekind Peano axioms Given these preparations Dedekind introduces the natural numbers as follows First he proves that every infinite set contains a simply infinite subset Then he establishes that any two simply infinite systems any two models of the Dedekind Peano axioms are isomorphic so that the axiom system is categorical Third he observes that as a consequence exactly the same arithmetic truths hold for all simple infinities or closer to Dedekind s actual way of stating this point any truth about one of them can be translated via the isomorphism into a truth about the other That is to say all models of the Dedekind Peano axioms are logically equivalent which means that the axiom system is semantically complete cf Awodey Reck In those respects each simply infinity is as good as any other As a further step Dedekind appeals again to the notion of creation Starting with some simple infinity constructed initially it doesn t matter which one we start with given their isomorphism he creates new objects corresponding to its elements thereby introducing a distinguished simple infinity Dedekind calls the natural numbers As we saw this last step is parallel to his introduction of the real numbers a parallel confirmed in Dedekind b but some aspects are clearer in the present case Namely the newly created objects are characterized completely by all arithmetic truths i e by those truths transferable or invariant in the sense explained above In other words their identity depends on relational or structural properties alone unlike for the elements of other simple infinities where intrinsic non arithmetic or foreign properties are built in In passing Dedekind also uses the name abstraction for the step from the initially constructed simple infinity to the newly introduced one If Dedekind is interpreted along such lines his position is a form of non eliminative structuralism cf Reck but see Sieg Morris and Benis Sinaceur respectively for two alternative interpretations We will again come back to this issue in Section Considered more generally what Dedekind has introduced is the natural numbers conceived of as finite ordinal numbers or counting numbers the first the second etc Later he adds an explanation of how their usual employment as finite cardinal numbers answering to the question how many can be recovered This is done by using initial segments of the number series as tallies for any set we can ask which such segment if any can be mapped one to one onto it thus measuring its cardinality A set turns out to be finite in the sense defined above if and only if there exists such an initial segment of the natural numbers series Dedekind rounds off his essay again by showing how several basic and so far merely assumed facts in arithmetic can now be proved as well Especially significant is his purely logical justification of proofs by mathematical induction and of definitions by recursion based on his theory of chains Set theoretic assumptions and procedures already inform Dedekind s Stetigkeit und irrationale Zahlen as we saw In particular the system of rational numbers is assumed to be an infinite set the collection of arbitrary cuts of rational numbers is treated as another infinite set and when supplied with arithmetic operations and an order relation on its elements the latter gives rise to a new complete ordered field Parallel moves can be found in the sketches from Dedekind s Nachlass on how to introduce the integers and the rational numbers Once more we start with an infinite system here that of all the natural numbers and new number systems are constructed out of it set theoretically although the full power set is not needed in those cases Finally Dedekind uses set theoretic techniques in his other mathematical work as well e g in his treatment of modular arithmetic and his construction of ideals as infinite sets to be discussed further below It should be emphasized that the application of such techniques was novel and bold at the time While a few mathematicians such as Cantor used them as well many others most prominently Kronecker rejected them In fact by working seriously with actual infinities Dedekind took a stance incompatible with that of his teacher Gauss who had allowed for the infinite only as a manner of speaking cf Ferreir s ch also Edwards In Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen in the context of Dedekind s logicist reconstruction of the natural numbers the adoption of set theoretic techniques is raised to a new level of clarity and generality Here Dedekind not only presents set theoretic definitions of various mathematical notions he also adds a systematic reflection on the means used thereby and he expands that use in certain respects For those reasons the essay constitutes an important step in the emergence of modern set theory In addition we already saw that Dedekind presents the notion of set together with those of object and function as basic Here an object is anything for which it is determinate how to reason about it including having appropriate criteria of identity Tait Sets are objects about which we reason by considering their elements and this is all that matters about them In other words sets are identified extensionally as Dedekind is one of the first to emphasize Even as important a contributor to set theory as Bertrand Russell struggles with this point well into the twentieth century Dedekind is also among the first to consider not just sets of numbers but sets of other kinds of objects as well Functions are to be conceived of extensionally too as ways of correlating the elements of sets But unlike in later axiomatic set theory Dedekind does not reduce functions to sets of tuples Not unreasonably he takes the ability to map one thing onto another or to represent one by the other to be fundamental for human thought Dedekind a preface cf Klev Another important aspect of Dedekind s views about functions is that with respect to their intended range he allows for arbitrary functional correlations between sets of numbers indeed between sets of objects more generally For the gradual development of his views in this connection see Sieg Schlimm He thus rejects previous often implicit restrictions of the notion of function to e g functions presented by familiar formulas functions representable in intuition via their graphs or functions decidable by a formal procedure In other words he works with a generalized notion of function In this respect he adopts and expands on the position of another of his teachers Dirichlet Stein Ferreir s ch Dedekind s notion of set is general in the same sense Such generalized notions of set and function together with the acceptance of the actual infinite were soon attacked by finitistically and constructively oriented mathematicians like Kronecker Dedekind defended his approach by pointing to its fruitfulness Dedekind a first footnote cf Edwards Ferreir s ch But eventually he came to see one feature of it as problematic his implicit acceptance of a general comprehension principle another sense in which his notion of set is unrestricted We already touched on a specific way in which this comes up in Dedekind s work Namely in Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen he introduces the totality of all things that can be objects of my thought his universal set together with arbitrary subsets of that totality a general Aussonderungsaxiom is used But then any collection of objects counts as a set for him As just noted Dedekind goes beyond considering only sets of numbers in his essay This is a significant extension of the notion of set or of its application an extension about which one might be concerned A more worrisome aspect consists of the particular way in which Dedekind s all encompassing totality is introduced namely by reference to human thought since this leads to the question of whether crude psychologistic features are involved more on that topic in Section But the most problematic feature and the one Dedekind came to take seriously himself is a third one his set theory is subject to set theoretic antinomies including Russell s antinomy If any collection of objects counts as a set then also Russell s collection of all sets that do not contain themselves and this leads quickly to a contradiction Dedekind seems to have found out about such problems from Cantor in the late s who informed him that the collection of all ordinal numbers is an inconsistent totality as is the collection of all objects of thought This news shocked him initially so much that he delayed republication of Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen he even expressed doubts about whether human thinking is fully rational Dedekind Vol p Dedekind a p Later he regained belief in the inner harmony of his approach but without providing a solution to these problems himself Dedekind Vol p Preface to the third edition published in Russell s antinomy and related ones establish that Dedekind s original conception of set is untenable Yet they do not invalidate his other contributions to set theory His analysis of continuity the use of Dedekind cuts in the introduction of the real numbers the definition of being Dedekind infinite the formulation of the Dedekind Peano axioms the proof of their categoricity the analysis of the natural numbers as finite ordinal numbers the justification of mathematical induction and recursion and most basically the insistence on extensional general notions of set and function as well as the acceptance of the actual infinite all of these contributions can be isolated from the set theoretic antinomies As such they have been built into the core of axiomatic set theory model theory recursion theory and other parts of logic And there are further contributions to set theory we owe to Dedekind Some of these do not appear in his published writings but in his correspondence Especially significant is his exchange of letters starting in with Cantor Noether Cavaill s Meschkowski Nilson These letters contain a comparative discussion of Cantor s and Dedekind s treatments of the real numbers Beyond that they amount to a joint exploration of the notions of set and infinity Among Dedekind s specific contributions in this context are the following He impresses Cantor with a proof that not only the set of rational numbers but also the set of all algebraic numbers is countable i e mappable one to one onto the set of natural numbers Ferreir s ch This result led at least in part to Cantor s further study of infinite cardinalities and to his discovery soon thereafter that the set of all real numbers is not countable Dedekind also provides a proof of the Cantor Bernstein Theorem that between any two sets which can be embedded one to one into each other there exists a bijection so that they have the same cardinality This is another basic result in the theory of transfinite cardinals Ferreir s ch Finally in the development of set theory during the twentieth century it became clear that several of Dedekind s results and procedures can be generalized in important ways Perhaps most significantly Zermelo and von Neumann succeeded in extending his analysis of mathematical induction and recursion to the higher infinite thus expanding on and establishing more firmly Cantor s theory of transfinite ordinals and cardinals Looking back on all of these contributions it is no wonder that Zermelo who knew the relevant history well considered the modern theory of sets as having been created by Cantor and Dedekind quoted in Ferreir s b So far we have focused on Dedekind s contributions in his overtly foundational writings We reviewed his innovative approaches to the natural and real numbers we also reconsidered his role in the rise of modern set theory Along the way some philosophical issues have come up A more extended reflection on them seems called for however especially concerning Dedekind s logicism and structuralism both topics that have led to some controversies in the secondary literature as already indicated parenthetically Like for Frege the other prominent logicist in the nineteenth century logic is more encompassing for Dedekind than often assumed today as comprising only first order logic Both thinkers take the notions of object set and function to be fundamental for human thought and as such to fall within the range of logic Each of them then develops a version of set theory a theory of systems extensions or classes seen as part of logic Also for both logic in this encompassing sense is independent of intuitive considerations and specifically of traditional Euclidean geometry understood to be grounded in pure or empirical intuition A main goal in reducing analysis and arithmetic to logic is thus to establish that those fields too are independent of intuition cf Demopoulos Clark The view that analysis is not dependent on geometry since it falls within the realm of arithmetical and basic logical thought was not entirely new at the time Gauss and Dirichlet already held such a view as mentioned above cf also Ferreir s What Frege s and Dedekind s new contributions consisted in were original detailed reductions of on the one hand analysis to arithmetic and on the other hand arithmetic to logic Moreover each of them complemented these reductions with systematic elaborations of logic As Dedekind s work was better known than Frege s at the time probably because of his greater reputation as a mathematician he was seen as the main representative of logicism by interested contemporaries such as C S Pierce Ernst Schr der and David Hilbert cf Ferreir s ch and Ferreir s In addition to these general commonalities in Dedekind s and Frege s works the two thinkers also agreed on a methodological principle encapsulated in the following remark by Dedekind In science and especially in mathematics nothing capable of proof ought to be accepted without proof Dedekind a preface This principle ought to be adhered to not so much because it increases certainty Rather it is often only by providing an explicit detailed proof for a result that the assumptions on which it depends become evident and thus its range of applicability established Both Frege and Dedekind had learned that lesson from the history of mathematics especially developments in geometry algebra and the calculus see Reck earlier Wilson Tappenden Ferreir s Detlefen Besides where they are in agreement it is instructive to consider some of the differences between Dedekind and Frege as well First and put in modern terminology a major difference is that while Frege s main contributions to logic concern syntactic proof theoretic aspects Dedekind tends to focus on semantic model theoretic aspects Thus nothing like Frege s revolutionary analysis of deductive inference by means of his Begriffsschrift can be found in Dedekind s works Dedekind in turn is much more explicit and clear than Frege about issues such as categoricity completeness independence etc This allows among others to see him as a precursor of the formal axiomatic approach championed later by Hilbert and Bernays Hallett Sieg Schlimm Sieg Compared to Frege Dedekind also has much more to say about the infinite not just by formulating a definition of that notion but also by exploring the possibility of different infinite cardinalities with Cantor And he shows more awareness of the challenge posed by Kroneckerian computational and constructivist strictures The differences between Frege s and Dedekind s respective treatments of the natural and real numbers are noteworthy too As we saw Dedekind conceives of the natural numbers primarily as ordinal numbers he also identifies them purely structurally Frege makes their application as cardinal numbers central and he insists on building this application into the very nature of the natural numbers thus endowing them with non structural intrinsic properties The case of the real numbers illustrates this divergence further Finally Frege s and Dedekind s underlying conceptions of logic and language differ significantly The latter is one of the main reasons why Dedekind is not interpreted as a logicist in Benis Sinaceur where those differences are highlighted in insightful ways Apart from Frege it is illuminating to compare Dedekind s approach more with later set theoretic ones We noted in the last section that many of his innovations have been built into axiomatic set theory Yet here too several differences emerge if one looks more closely To begin with Dedekind does not start with an axiom of infinity as a fundamental principle instead he tries to prove the existence of infinite sets This can be seen as another application of the methodological rule to prove everything capable of proof thus as a crucial aspect of his logicism However few set theorists today will want to go back to this aspect of Dedekind s approach Dedekind s argument for the existence of an infinite set is similar to an earlier one in Bolzano s posthumously published work cf Ferreir s ch Klev A second marked difference between Dedekind and current set theory has already come up too This is his appeal to abstraction and creation in the last step of his introduction of both the natural and the real numbers Dedekind abstraction as it is called in Tait For the real numbers the standard procedure in axiomatic set theory is to follow Dedekind up to this last step but then to work with the Dedekind cuts themselves as the real numbers While aware of this option Dedekind b b Dedekind tells us to apply abstraction to the cuts insofar as they consist of complex sets thus to create additional mathematical objects determined by but not identical with them Likewise for the the natural numbers it is standard to construct a particular simple infinity usually the set of finite von Neumann ordinals and then to identify the natural numbers with them thus emptyset etc Once again the step involving abstraction and creation in Dedekind is avoided In current approaches it is sometimes added that any other set theoretically constructed system isomorphic to the system of Dedekind cuts or to the system of finite von Neumann ordinals respectively would do as well i e be usable as the real numbers or the natural numbers for most mathematical purposes This means that contemporary set theory is often implicitly and without further elaboration supplemented by a set theoretic structuralist view about the nature of mathematical objects Reck Price The resulting position is different from Dedekind s But see again Sieg Morris where Dedekind is interpreted as changing his position over time and in particular as adopting a position close to set theoretic structuralism by Nor does Dedekind s position coincide with several other forms of structuralism prominent in contemporary philosophy of mathematics e g those defended by Geoffrey Hellman or by Stewart Shapiro Why do most mathematicians and philosophers not follow Dedekind in this respect Here the following difficulties play a role cf Boolos M ller Stach among others How exactly should his notions of abstraction and creation be understood if they can be made sense of at all And why did Dedekind insist on their use since we seem to be able to do without them as axiomatic set theory shows A partial answer to the latter question is For Dedekind the real numbers should not be identified with corresponding cuts because those cuts have wrong properties namely as sets they contain elements which seems foreign to the real numbers themselves Similarly the natural numbers should not be ascribed set theoretic or other foreign properties they too should be conceived of purely arithmetically see again Dedekind b b Can anything further be said in this connection By philosophical critics Dedekind s procedure is often interpreted as follows As his language of abstraction and creation seems to suggest he is appealing to psychological processes The resulting entities the real number and the natural numbers must then be psychological or mental entities existing in people s subjective consciousness If that was correct his position would amount to a form of psychologism about mathematics that is deeply problematic as Frege Husserl and others have taught us cf Dummett Partly to avoid such a damning conclusion partly to attribute more philosophical depth to Dedekind the following reply can be found in the literature While he does not say so explicitly Dedekind s psychologistic sounding language indicates a commitment to Kantian assumptions in particular to Kant s transcendental psychology Kitcher McCarty Klev cf also Benis Sinaceur Floyd Then again it is not clear that this reply takes care of the psychologism charge fully often also directed against Kant so that such a response would have to be spelled out further cf Yap Reck earlier Cassirer In itself it also leaves unexplained the precise form of Dedekind s abstraction Recently another suggestion for how to get clearer about Dedekind abstraction and at the same time avoid crude forms of psychologism has become prominent Instead of taking such abstraction to amount to a psychological process it should be understood as a logical procedure cf Reck earlier Tait Cassirer Consider again the case of the natural numbers where Dedekind is most explicit about this issue What he provides us with is this First the language and logic to be used are specified thus the kinds of assertions and arguments that can be made concerning the natural numbers second a particular simple infinity is constructed third this simple infinity is used to determine the truth values of all arithmetic sentences by equating them with the truth values of corresponding sentences for the given simple infinity and fourth this determination is justified by showing that all simple infinities are isomorphic so that if a sentence holds for one of them it holds for all The core of the procedure just described is the following Something is true for the natural numbers exactly when the corresponding statement holds for all simple infinities i e is a semantic consequence of the Dedekind Peano axioms What then are the natural numbers They are those mathematical objects whose properties are determined by all arithmetic truths we abstract away from everything else in this logical sense Moreover this procedure can be spelled out further precisely and consistently in terms of structural abstraction principles cf Linnebo Pettigrew Reck Along such lines all that matters about mathematical objects indeed all that is built into their identity and nature is what the corresponding mathematical truths determine Thus it is by specifying those truths that we create or better fully characterize them The resulting position is not psychologistic and it might be called logical structuralism Reck also Yap a Interpreted as such Dedekind s approach is related to that of the American Postulate Theorists E Huntington O Veblen etc cf Awodey Reck There is also a close connection to and a clear influence on the formal axiomatics developed by Hilbert and Bernays later cf Sieg also Hallett For all of these thinkers what is both crucial in and sufficient for mathematics is that the completeness and consistency of certain basic concepts or of the corresponding systems of axioms are established In Dedekind s case completeness is to be understood in a semantic sense as based on categoricity likewise consistency is to be understood semantically as satisfiability Dedekind and both are tied to his distinctive combination of logicism and structuralism The syntactic study of such issues especially of consistency that became a core part of Hilbertian proof theory is not present in Dedekind s work As already noted the proof theoretic side of logic is not pursued much by him Nor is the finitism characteristic of Hilbert Bernays later work present in Dedekind an aspect developed in response to the set theoretic antinomies like Russell s and to intuitionist challenges especially if it is understood in a metaphysical sense Such finitism might have been acceptable to Dedekind as a methodological stance but in other respects his position is strongly and clarly infinitary In fact the finite is explained in terms of the infinite in his work the notion of finitude by that of infinity the natural numbers in terms of infinite sets etc as noted in Hilbert The summary of Dedekind s position in the present section highlighted logical issues his basic logical notions and procedures compared both to Frege and to axiomatic set theory together with metaphysical issues Dedekindian abstraction and creation the structural nature of mathematical objects However there is another dimension of his position another sense in which Dedekind s approach represents a unique combination of logicism and structuralism that deserves philosophical attention That side involves primarily methodological and epistemological aspects Some of those aspects already played a role in our discussions of his overtly foundational writings But in order to shed more light on them it helps to turn to his other mathematical work starting with algebraic number theory While historians of mathematics have long emphasized the influence Dedekind s work on algebraic number theory had on the development of twentieth century mathematics the philosophical significance of these contributions has only started to be probed recently with some exceptions Dugac Sinaceur Edwards Stein We should begin here by reviewing two aspects the roots of Dedekind s number theoretic investigations in the works of Gauss Dirichlet and Ernst Kummer and the contrast between Dedekind s approach and that of Leopold Kronecker The starting point for these number theorists was the solution of algebraic equations especially their solution in terms of integers A famous example is Fermat s Last Theorem which concerns the non solubility of the equation x n y n z n by integers for different exponents n The approach to the problem developed by Gauss clarified and refined by Dirichlet and pushed further by Kummer involves considering extensions of the field of rational numbers as well as of the ring of integers contained in such extensions Thus Gauss studied the Gaussian integers a bi where a and b are regular integers and i sqrt within the field of all complex numbers Kummer considered more complicated cyclotomic integers in corresponding number fields Edwards Stillwell Gray What became clear along such lines is that in some of these extensions the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic asserting the unique factorization of all integers into powers of primes fails Had it been available generally solutions for important problems would have been within reach including Fermat s Last Theorem The question became then whether a suitable alternative to the Fundamental Theorem could be found Kummer s response obtained in a close study of some particular cases was to introduce ideal divisors in terms of which unique factorization could be recovered While this move led to striking progress the nature of these new mathematical objects was left unclear as were the precise basis for their introduction and the range of applicability of the technique Both Dedekind and Kronecker knew this earlier work well especially Kummer s and tried to build on it Kronecker s strategy was to examine in concrete detail and by exploiting computational aspects certain kinds of extensions Crucial for him was to proceed finitistically and constructively thus in a self consciously restricted way This led to his divisor theory an extension of Gauss and Kummer s theory of forms Edwards Dedekind approached the issue in a more encompassing and abstract way He considered algebraic number fields in general thereby introducing the notion of a field for the first time Edwards Haubrich Stillwell Ullrich Gray Dedekind also replaced Kummer s ideal numbers by his ideals set theoretical objects intended to play the same role with respect to unique factorization Dedekindian ideals are infinite subsets of the number fields in question or of the corresponding ring of integers which again gives his approach an infinitary character An ideal I in a ring R is a subset such that the sum and difference of any two elements of I and the product of any element of I with any element of R are also in I This led him to introduce other fruitful notions too such as that of a module A problem Dedekind struggled with for a while in the sense of finding a fully satisfactory solution was to specify a suitable version not only of the notion of integer but also of prime number Ferreir s ch Avigad Haffner Both Kronecker with his divisor theory and Dedekind with his ideal theory were able to obtain important results Each theory also had a strong influence Dedekind s by shaping the approaches to modern algebra field theory ring theory etc of Hilbert Emmy Noether B L van der Waerden Emil Artin Nicolas Bourbaki and others Alten et al Corry McLarty Gray Kronecker s by influencing Hilbert as well and by being revived later in Andr Weil s and Alexander Grothendieck s works class field theory algebraic geometry Weil Edwards Reed Corfield The contrast between their approaches provides a clear example historically the first significant example of the opposition between classical and constructivist mathematics Often this opposition is debated in terms of which approach is the right one with the implication that only one of them but not the other is legitimate This started with the disagreement between Dedekind and Kronecker We already noted that Dedekind explicitly rejected constructivist strictures on his work although he did not rule out corresponding projects as illegitimate in themselves Kronecker with his strong opposition to the use of set theoretic and infinitary techniques went further in the opposite direction But another question is more basic Can the contrast between the two competing approaches to algebraic number theory or to mathematics more generally be captured more sharply and insightfully and in particular what is its methodological and epistemological significance An initial rough answer to that question is already contained in our discussion so far namely Dedekind s approach is set theoretic and infinitary while Kronecker s is constructivist and finitary Yet that leaves us with a deeper issue What exactly is it that a set theoretic and infinitary methodology allows us to accomplish that Kronecker s doesn t and vice versa The specific strength of a Kroneckerian approach is often summed up thus It provides us with instructive computational algorithmic information Edwards Avigad But what is the characteristic virtue of a Dedekindian approach Here an informative and articulate answer is harder to find especially one that is philosophically satisfying What tends to get in the way is that the set theoretic and infinitary methodology Dedekind championed was so successful thus shaping twentieth century mathematics so much that it is hard to reach the analytic distance needed Often all one gets then are platitudes that it is very general and abstract Or one is left with negative characterizations that it fails to be finitistically and constructively acceptable More positively there is the suggestion that Dedekind s approach is structuralist But as this term is now used to characterize a methodology rather than a metaphysical position one wonders what exactly it involves Before attempting a clarification let us briefly consider some of Dedekind s other mathematical works since this will make certain relevant features stand out more For our purposes three further areas in which Dedekind applied his set theoretic infinitary and structuralist approach are relevant the theory of algebraic functions group theory and lattice theory Dedekind realized early on that several of the notions and techniques he had introduced in algebraic number theory could be transferred to the study of algebraic functions algebraic function fields in later terminology especially the set theoretic introduction of ideals and ways of calculating with them cf Haffner especially for the latter This realization came to fruition in Theorie der algebraischen Funktionen einer Ver nderlichen a substantive article co written with Heinrich Weber and published in The approach in it led among others to a better understanding of Riemann surfaces including a purely algebraic proof of the celebrated Riemann Roch Theorem Geyer Kolmogorov Yushkevich ch Stillwell As these were issues of wide interest among mathematicians the success gave Dedekind s approach legitimacy and publicity cf Edwards Dieudonn Second Dedekind s contributions to algebraic number theory were connected in natural and fruitful ways with Evariste Galois revolutionary group theoretic approach to algebra In fact Dedekind s early study of Galois theory he was the first to lecture on it at a German university already during his time as a Privatdozent in G ttingen led to a transformation of that theory itself It turned from the study of substitutions in formulas and of functions invariant under such substitutions into the study of field extensions and corresponding automorphisms which deep connections to algebraic number theory Mehrtens b Stein Ferreir s Reck Dedekind also introduced additional applications of Galois theory e g to modular equations and functions Gray ch Alten et al ch As a third spin off Dedekind s number theoretic investigations led to the introduction of the notion of a lattice under the name Dualgruppe He examined that notion further also as a topic in itself in two relatively late articles ber Zerlegungen von Zahlen durch ihre gr ten gemeinsamen Teiler and ber die von drei Moduln erzeugte Dualgruppe as well as in some unpublished manuscripts cf Haffner which also explores connection to the notion of duality in some detail While these articles did not have the same immediate and strong impact that several of his other publications had they were later recognized as original systematic contributions to lattice theory especially to the study of modular lattices Mehrtens a ch Burris Alten et al ch Haffner and to an axiomatic approach to mathematics more generally Schlimm None of these contributions by Dedekind can be treated in any detail here and various others have to be ignored completely but some general observations about them can be made For more details and some recent discussions see Gray Ferreir s Reck and Haffner While they again exemplify a set theoretic and infinitary perspective they also display the following features the focus on entire systems of objects and on general laws for them the move away from particular formulas or particular symbolic representations to more general characterizations of the underlying systems of objects specifically in terms of relational and functional properties the consideration of homomorphisms automorphisms isomorphisms and features invariant under such mappings and the investigation of novel abstract concepts introduced in connection with specific cases but then studied in themselves These features are in fact characteristic for Dedekind s works overall including his studies in algebraic number theory and his foundational investigations It is by taking them into account that calling his methodology not just general and abstract but structuralist starts to acquire further content One can also see in which way Dedekind s approach played a crucial role in the emergence of modern mathematics as shaped significantly by a structuralist methodology cf Reck Schiemer also Corry Gray Looking back on the corresponding history of algebra B L van der Waerden himself a major contributor to this field concluded It was Evariste Galois and Richard Dedekind who gave modern algebra its structure that is where its weight bearing skeleton comes from Dedekind foreword quoted in Mehrtens b cf also Gray Benis Sinaceur Haffner In earlier sections we considered Dedekind s overtly foundational works This led to a discussion of logicism and the metaphysical structuralism emerging in them In the last few sections the focus shifted to his other mathematical contributions and the methodological structuralism they embody Now we are in a position to provide a more explicit and systematic elaboration of the latter Beyond just calling Dedekind s approach set theoretic infinitary and non constructive the methodology that informs it can be analyzed as consisting of three parts The first part is closely tied to Dedekind s employment of set theoretic tools and techniques He uses these to construct new mathematical objects the natural and real numbers ideals etc or whole classes of such objects algebraic number fields rings modules lattices etc usually in terms of infinite sets Closely related but even more characteristic for Dedekind is the following These sets are then endowed with general structural features order relations arithmetic operations etc and the resulting systems are studied in terms of corresponding higher level concepts continuity for the real number system simple infinity for the natural numbers unique factorization in algebraic number fields and function fields etc Once more philosophically relevant is not just that this procedure is infinitary actual infinities are accepted and non constructive the added features are not necessarily grounded in algorithms A whole variety of relational systems including many new ones can now be investigated as well and this brings with it a significant extension of the subject matter of mathematics Mathematics is no longer tied to what is given intuitively or even empirically concrete numbers of things geometric magnitudes observable physical processes etc it has become the study of relational systems much more generally based on a new logic of relations as Russell and Cassirer will put it The second characteristic part of Dedekind s methodology consists of persistently and from early on cf Dedekind attempting to identify and clarify fundamental concepts including the higher level concepts just mentioned continuity infinity generalized concepts of integer and of prime number also the new concepts of ideal module lattice etc In this context it is crucial for him to find the right definitions and this involves not just basic adequacy but also desiderata or epistemic values such as fruitfulness generality simplicity and purity i e the elimination of foreign aspects Geometric notions are foreign to the natural and real numbers the definition of prime number must be at just the right level of generality etc Moreover once Dedekind has identified them he studies the most important ones also in themselves i e in terms of a separate parts of theories This gives his approach a distinctive conceptual character cf Stein Reck Avigad and it points forward towards an axiomatic approach Sieg Schlimm Schlimm also Benis Sinaceur and Haffner The third main part of Dedekind s approach connects and complements the first two Not only does he study infinite systems of objects or whole classes of such systems and not only does he attempt to identify basic concepts applicable to them especially higher level concepts He also tends to do both often in conjunction by considering mappings on the systems studied especially structure preserving mappings homomorphisms isomorphisms implicitly also category theoretic functors etc This shows that what is crucial about a mathematical phenomenon may not lie on the surface concrete features of examples particular symbolisms etc but go deeper And while the deeper features are often captured set theoretically Dedekind cuts ideals quotient structures etc it points beyond set theory in the end towards category theory especially in Dedekind s later works Corry McLarty Ferreir s a b Ferreir s Reck These three parts of Dedekind s approach may not seem extraordinary to a contemporary mathematician But that is just testimony to how much modern mathematics has been shaped by his work His approach was certainly seen as novel even revolutionary at the time Some negative reactions to it by finitist and constructivist thinkers have already been mentioned The extent to which Dedekind s approach diverged from what had been common stands out further if we remember two traditional widely shared assumptions that mathematics is the science of number and magnitude and that it has essentially to do with calculating and other algorithmic procedures Relative to such assumptions Dedekind s approach to mathematics involves a radical transformation and liberation Stein Tait Reck Another way to bring out the radical character of Dedekind s work is by returning to his treatment of the infinite It starts with what had long been seen as a paradoxical property to be equinumerous with a proper subset and turns it into a defining characteristic of infinite sets instead Dedekind then adds a systematic and wide ranging analysis of the finite in terms of the infinite again a rather bold idea For conceptual and methodological innovations like these to become accepted they not only had to open up novel realms for mathematics the resulting approach also had to lead to progress in more traditional realms as it did the clarification of continuity and of mathematical induction and recursion new results in algebra algebraic number theory the theory of algebraic functions etc While Dedekind was a great innovator he was of course not alone in moving large parts of mathematics in a set theoretic infinitary and structuralist direction There was a whole group of mathematicians who promoted a more conceptual approach at the time including several of his teachers in G ttingen Within that group Dirichlet has sometimes been picked out as the leader or the poet s poet among others by being a big influence on Dedekind Stein compare also Merzbach As Hermann Minkowski a major figure in this tradition himself put it later on the occasion of Dirichlet s th birthday he impressed on other mathematicians to conquer the problems with a minimum amount of blind calculation a maximum of clear seeing thought quoted in Stein Riemann was another crucial figure in this context He too had a strong influence on Dedekind in two ways by emphasizing in his development of complex function theory the importance of using simple characteristic and intrinsic concepts in contrast to extrinsic properties tied to say particular symbolisms Mehrtens b Laugwitz Tappenden a Ferreir s Reck and by exploring new conceptual possibilities including the systematic study of Riemannian geometries Stein A further example of such conceptual exploration again very familiar to Dedekind was the study of transfinite ordinal and cardinal numbers by Cantor with whom Dedekind corresponded Ferreir s chs and And of course later mathematicians influenced by Dirichlet Riemann Dedekind and Cantor pushed their innovations further including Ernst Zermelo Emmy Noether B L van de Waerden and Nicolas Bourbaki Corry McLarty Kahle Can the significance of Dedekind s methodology be brought out even further Can it perhaps also be articulated in different terms One way to do the latter already touched on above is by highlighting the methodological values embodied in it systematicity generality purity etc Avigad also Haffner Another is by focusing on the kind of reasoning involved conceptual or structural reasoning Stein Ferreir s Ferreir s Reck or in terminology often associated with Hilbert axiomatic reasoning Sieg Schlimm Schlimm We might even talk about a novel reasoning style in this connection where style is understood in an epistemological sense not an aesthetic psychological or sociological one Such a style brings with it not just new theorems and proofs but a distinctive kind of understanding of mathematical facts Reck Reck Schiemer section also Tappenden b M ller Stach These attempts to reveal the full significance of Dedekind s approach are initial forays and in need of further elaboration However one aspect seems clear enough The methodological and epistemological perspective that shapes Dedekind s mathematical works is not independent of the logical and metaphysical views emerging in his more foundational writings This is no accident if one adopts his methodological stance it is hardly possible to hold on to narrowly computational formalist empiricist or intuitionist views about mathematics More specifically a structuralist methodology along Dedekindian lines calls for a structuralist metaphysics as two sides of the same coin Dedekind seems to have been keenly aware of this fact even if he left it mostly implicit it much in his writings We started out by considering Dedekind s contributions to the foundations of mathematics in his overtly foundational writings the two booklets Stetigkeit und irrationale Zahlen and Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen We then added a sketch and preliminary analysis of the methodological innovations in his more mainstream mathematical writings from his work in algebraic number theory to other areas We also noted that the logical and metaphysical position in his foundational work is closely tied to his more general methodological and epistemological perspective It is in this sense that any attempt to distinguish sharply between his foundational and his other mathematical writings is misguided Dedekind made foundationally relevant contributions throughout his work In fact his case provides a good argument and illustration for a more general lesson Namely any strict distinction between foundational or philosophical questions about mathematics on the one hand and inner mathematical or practice based questions on the other hand is counterproductive in the end especially if one does not want to impoverish both sides If we look at Dedekind s contributions from such a perspective the sum total is impressive He was not only one of the greatest mathematicians of the nineteenth century he was also one of its subtlest philosophers of mathematics With his structuralist views about the nature of mathematical entities and about how to investigate them he was far ahead of his time He was even ahead of much current philosophy of mathematics especially with his sensitivity to both sides This is not to say that his position is without problems Dedekind himself was troubled by the set theoretic antinomies at least initially And the twentieth century produced additional surprises such as G del s Incompleteness Theorems that are difficult to accommodate for everyone Moreover the methodology of mathematics has developed further since his time including attempts to reconcile conceptual and computational thinking e g in computer assisted proofs Then again is there a philosophical position available today that answers all important questions about mathematics in a satisfactory way If not updating and reviving a Dedekindian position remains a worthwhile project Works listed in this

The subject of combinations of logics is still a young topic in contemporary logic Besides the pure philosophical interest offered by the possibility of defining mixed logic systems in which distinct operators obey logics of different nature as for instance erotetic logics the logical analysis of questions which require combining epistemic and deontic logics there also exist many pragmatic and methodological reasons for considering combined logics In fact the use of formal logic as a tool for knowledge representation in Computer Science frequently requires the integration of several logic systems into a homogeneous environment Important questions in the philosophy of logic such as why are there so many logics instead of just one or even instead of none as for instance raised in Epstein can be naturally counterposed by several other questions if there are indeed many logics are they excluding alternatives or are they compatible Is it possible to combine different logics into coherent systems with the purpose of using them in applications and to shed some light on the properties of complex logics Moreover if we can compose logics why not decompose them And if a logic is decomposed into elementary sublogics is it possible to recover it by combining such fragments What kind of properties of logics can be transferred to their combinations Questions of this kind have been only partially tackled in the literature and reflect challenges to be confronted in the evolution of this topic David Hume generated a popular controversy with his famous passages of A Treatise of Human Nature see Hume Book Part Section paragraph where he noted that sometimes people draw conclusions involving prescriptive statements of the form ought to be on the basis of descriptive statements of the form what is Hume thinks that logic used in this way involves a dangerous change of subject matter So whether or not ought can be derived from is has become one of the central questions of ethical theory and the majority of interpreters hold that for Hume such a derivation is impossible With our point of view concerning combinations of logics it is necessary to investigate the properties of combining deontic and alethic logics in order to perform such a jump from is to ought some authors propose see e g Schurz that what is necessary is an explicit bridge principle which specifically connects is and ought An axiom schema X following Schurz is a bridge principle iff X contains at least one schematic letter which has at least one occurrence within the scope of an obcirc the deontic obligation operator and at least one occurrence outside the scope of any obcirc Thus for instance p rightarrow obcirc p is a bridge principle representing is ought that which would appease Hume s criticism On the other hand the much discussed moral principle ought implies can controversially attributed to I Kant see Baumgardt can be formalized through another bridge principle obcirc p rightarrow lozenge p where lozenge denotes the alethic possibility operator Clearly bridge principles do not solve any philosophical questions such as the is ought problem nonetheless they contribute to clarify the problem and to uncover hidden assumptions The idea of combining logics lend clarification to questions of this kind by making clear that for instance is and ought are indeed independent notions This is elucidated through a formal analysis of the composition of the logics involved in this case alethic and deontic or by decomposition of the complex logic in this case bimodal into simpler ones In such circumstances combining logics can be perceived as a tool for simplifying problems involving heterogeneous reasoning The fact that ought is not conveyed as a predicate but as a modal operator ranging over actions or states of affairs was responsible for the delay of formal treatments of this centuries old question Such a treatment was only possible after the development of general modal logic Indeed what we are dealing with here is a bimodal logic which is properly treated only after a deeper understanding of the semantical subtleties of mixing alethic and deontic logics Moreover according to some philosophers who have argued that it is not possible to link is and ought that is who defend Hume s thesis that no non trivial is ought deductions are possible it is mandatory to use combinations of first order alethic and deontic logics see e g Stuhlmann Laeisz and Schurz A Prior using the apparatus of contemporary modal logic tried to characterize the distinction between normative and non normative sentences in formal terms which enabled him to define senses of descriptive content versus normative content A problem however occurs with mixed sentences which have both descriptive and normative components and Prior comes up with a paradox wherever we draw the distinction between non normative and normative sentences unexpected inferences from non normative premises to normative conclusions may appear by a mere use of laws of classical propositional logic Consider for instance the following two inferences formalized as and formalized as If the mixed sentence texttt d vee obcirc texttt s is considered to be normative then is an example of an is ought inference and if it is considered to be non normative then is an example of an is ought inference So one of them dichotomically represents a violation of Hume s thesis in Prior s terms Prior concluded from this paradox that Hume s is ought thesis is simply false see Prior one can simply derive conclusions which are ethical starting from premises which have no ethical character Prior recognized however that the inferences involved in the paradox are ethically irrelevant or trivial but neither he nor later authors could find a suitable definition of what it would mean by ethical irrelevance or ethical triviality attached to an inference for a discussion on this respect see Weiss Using the semantics of modal logics objections against this conclusion can be raised as for example in Karmo in the sense of separating statements between evaluative in some possible worlds and descriptive in others while keeping their meaning By using concepts of combinations of languages and combinations of logics G Schurz see Schurz see also Schurz was able to state a generalized Hume s thesis GH as observed in subsection this treatment is in fact a fusion of two modal logics In GH a mixed sentence varphi is derived from a set of purely descriptive sentences i e sentences free of obcirc only if varphi is completely obcirc irrelevant that is predicates in varphi within the scope of obcirc can be replaced by other predicates salva valididate Moreover it is proven that GH holds in an alethic deontic first order logic mathcal L if and only if mathcal L can be axiomatized without bridge principles The notion of bridge principle lies in the scope of combination of languages In general many bridge principles can be made explicit within modal logic and will be relevant for analyzing relationships among diverse modalities For example if we take necessity square and possibility lozenge as primitive operators then lozenge p to neg square neg p is an intuitionistically acceptable bridge principle while the converse is not Besides Hume s problem another example of bimodal logic with intrinsic philosophical interest where bridge principles intervene is the logic of physical and alethic modalities In this logic the language permits the expression of two different notions of necessity namely logical necessity symbolized by square and physical necessity symbolized by boxdot The simplest connection between physical necessity and logical necessity that comprises an acceptable philosophical meaning is given by the following bridge axiom quad square p to boxdot p meaning that logical necessity is stronger than physical necessity that is anything that is logically necessary is physically necessary The resulting logic KT boxdot is axiomatized by the well known axioms and rules of KT for both modalities in addition to the bridge axiom above and is semantically characterized by Kripke frames with two accessibility relations requiring that the accessibility relation for physical necessity is included in the other Not only bimodal but multimodal also called polymodal logics are standard in the literature A typical case is the logic of knowledge or epistemic logic usually endowed with modal operators K K ldots K m representing the knowledge of m agents or knowers The formula K i alpha means agent i knows alpha and the language is able to express for instance i knows that j does not know that i knows p by means of K i neg K j K i p No additional mixing principles are mandatory for the combined logic of many agents but bridge axioms may of course be added A detailed discussion about modal systems combining different modalities as well as their philosophical interpretations can be found in the entry on philosophical aspects of multi modal logic The interest of studying combinations of logics may thus be seen as a reflection of the pluralist view in contemporary logical research Indeed this kind of bridge axioms can in principle connect completely distinct logics Van Benthem suggests that combining logics may lead to the emergence of new phenomena depending on the mode of combination and moreover it may work as an inspiration and perhaps as a model for the study of combining epistemic notions He even suggests that the compartmentalization of logic into subfields as modal temporal epistemic doxastic erotetic or deontic logic has been harmful to philosophical logic Combinations of logics go in the opposite direction of such a compartmentalization by contending that almost any conceptual task to be analyzed involves immediate reasoning concerning necessity obligation action time verbal tense knowledge belief etc From a philosophical point of view logical combinations may be the right way to look at philosophical issues within the theory of causation of action and so on The idea of looking at logic as an entirety avoiding fragmentation is not new and philosophers and logicians from Ram n Lull to Gottfried W Leibniz have thought of building schemes where different logics or logic like mechanisms could interact and cooperate instead of competing In contemporary terms the first methods for combining logics were products of logics introduced by K Segerberg and independently by V ehtman fusion introduced by R Thomason and fibring introduced by D Gabbay a all of them dedicated to combining only modal logics It is worth noting that M Fitting gave early examples of fusions of modal logics anticipating the notion of fusion Other combination mechanisms followed such as parameterization and temporalization which were more on the side of software specification Most of these methods have been encompassed in the algebraic fibring introduced by A Sernadas C Sernadas and C Caleiro which considerably improved the versatility of these techniques by means of universal categorial constructions in this way making it possible to combine wider classes of logics besides modal logics On the other hand making heavy use of the language of category theory J Goguen and R Burstall introduced the notion of institutions as a kind of abstract model theory devoted to applications in Computer Science see Goguen and Burstall Institutions are also used as a mechanism for combining logics However combining logics does not only mean synthesizing or composing logics but can also yield interesting examples that go in the opposite direction of decomposing logics see section A paradigmatic methodology for decomposition is the possible translations semantics a notion proposed in Carnielli designed to help solve the problem of assigning semantic interpretations to non classical logics Examples of possible translations semantics illustrate how a complex logic can be analyzed into less complex factors Other techniques such as direct union of matrices and plain fibring see Coniglio and Fern ndez can be considered to be methods for both composing and decomposing All of these methods open the way for a new question in the realm of combinations of logics Is it possible to decompose a given logic into elementary ones In other words are there prime logics which combined in an appropriate way may produce all or part of the familiar logic systems This question will be retaken in section Results on combinations of logics may quickly become too technical when we turn to the combination of higher order modal relevance logics or non truth functional logics and thus refinements of the notion of algebraic fibring such as modulated fibring see C Sernadas et al b or cryptofibring see Caleiro and Ramos may be necessary to solve for example some collapsing problems within combinations of logics see section This naturally leads to the use of category theory as a universal language and as a tool to deal with such problems But the fact is that combinations of logics do not necessarily depend upon any highly technical methodology and even some relatively simple examples can be really expressive There is a recognized intersection and interaction between philosophy and theoretical computer science and techniques for combining logics are also revealed to be very apt tools for handling and thus better understanding Kripke models Having been introduced in the domain of philosophical logic Kripke models are essential in computer science and artificial intelligence as semantic structures for logics of belief knowledge temporal logics logics for actions etc Knowledge representation and reasoning may require combining several reasoning formalisms including combinations of temporal reasoning reasoning in description logic reasoning about space and distance and so on Logics combining temporal and modal dimensions are also becoming a relevant tool in agent oriented programming languages Other applications of combinations of logics include software specification knowledge representation architectures for intelligent computing and quantum computing security protocols and authentication secure computation and zero knowledge proof systems besides their connections to formal ethics and game semantics The Belief Desire Intention model of agents BDI is concerned with the formal representation of practical reasoning involving action intention belief will deliberation goal driven modeling etc This kind of reasoning is essential for planning especially for artificial agents It is then just natural to think about combining simple modal logics for knowledge belief obligation capability opportunity etc so as to define more robust BDI logics Governatori et al investigates the relationships between BDI logics and a particular case of Gabbay s fibring semantics see subsection called dovetailing showing that a general logical account of BDI can be handled by means of dovetailing multimodal logics But combinations of logics also work from another perspective instead of directly combining logic systems and looking for the interpretation of the resulting system one can start from a purely mathematical perspective In van Benthem et al for instance the authors introduce the notion of horizontal and vertical topologies on the product of topological spaces and show that the modal logic of products of topological spaces with horizontal and vertical topologies coincides with the fusion of S with itself The resulting completeness proof has deep connections with some topological properties of the real and of the rational numbers It is reasonable to expect that a method for combining logics would work in two opposite directions On the one hand a logic that one wants to investigate could be decomposed into factors of lesser complexity for instance a bimodal alethic deontic logic could be decomposed into its alethic and deontic fragments In this case it would be relevant to see if the logic under investigation is the least extension of its factors or if additional bridge principles would have to be added This approach in which a given logic is decomposed into possibly simpler factors is said to be a process of splitting logics On the other hand one might be interested in creating new logic systems where different aspects are integrated starting from given logics This demand typically occurs in software engineering and security where knowledge representation formal specification and verification of algorithms and protocols have a marked need for working with several logics In a less pragmatical scenery this would be the case if one is interested for instance in adding a modal dimension to an intuitionistic or a paraconsistent logic Moreover it is interesting to characterize which properties of the factors can be transferred to the combined logic This direction is said to be a process of splicing logics The essential distinctions between splicing in the direction of synthesis and splitting in the direction of analysis take into account the intentions one may have in mind and consequently each direction encompasses specifically designed techniques The paradigm of splicing logics assumes a bottom up perspective It combines given logics synthesizing them and producing a new one The combined logic should be minimal in some sense that is if cal L is obtained from cal L and cal L by some combination process it should be expected that cal L extends both cal L and cal L and cal L is a minimal extension of both cal L and cal L For instance some methods may require cal L to be the least conservative extension of both cal L and cal L This point will be discussed in section On the other hand splitting a logic cal L assumes a top down perspective Logics are decomposed into presumably simpler factors It should be stressed that most of the methods for combining logics found in the literature are better understood from the splicing perspective placing prominence on the creation of a logic system from familiar logics However some splicing methods such as fusion see subsection are more usefully regarded as a method of decomposition of logics into simpler fragments and in this way also work in the splitting direction Possible translations semantics see subsection on the other hand constitute a typical method within the splitting perspective Suppose that two given logics cal L and cal L are to be combined using some technique It should be obvious that any method applied to combine cal L and cal L will create a new logic cal L which contains the signature logic symbols such as connectives quantifiers propositional variables etc of both logics that is cal L will be defined in a mixed language which allows combinations of symbols of the underlying languages That is a combination of logic systems presupposes the previous combination of the respective signatures This is why the choice of the signature of the combined system is as important as the logic itself For instance the definition of the language of parameterization is fundamental in order to obtain the intended combined logic see subsection Another example is found in Schurz where the formal treatment of Hume s is ought problem recall section presupposes careful handling of subtle combinations of languages Besides the definition of the appropriate language for the combined logic another important question that immediately arises is Should the logics cal L and cal L to be combined be presented in the same way In other words Is it possible to combine logics defined by different paradigms For instance how could one combine a logic cal L defined by a sequent calculus with a logic cal L represented by a Hilbert style axiomatic system How should the resulting logic cal L be represented as a sequent calculus as an axiomatic system or as a mixed proof system Consider now another even worse situation when the logic cal L is described by semantical means that is through semantic structures such as valuations or Kripke models whereas the logic cal L is presented through a syntactical proof system such as a natural deduction system sequent calculus or a Hilbert style axiomatization Could the resulting combined logic be better presented semantically or syntactically This annoyance does not occur in the majority of cases where the logics being combined are complete with respect to some kind of semantics and are syntactically presented in a homogeneous way Still there are logics which are only reasonably presented by syntactical means or exclusively by semantical means Such is the case e g of the first order theory of torsion groups known to be non axiomatizable and of incomplete modal logics which are only presented in syntactical proof theoretical terms A possible solution to the problem of combining heterogeneous logics which naturally leads us to the deeper question of what is a logic is to consider a common component of the majority of logics their respective consequence relations Thus given cal L and cal L presented in different ways it is always possible to extract the respective consequence relations and then combine them taking for instance their supremum in an appropriate lattice of consequence relations But in this way the resulting logic cal L is presented in a very abstract form because the only information available from cal L is its consequence relation and so the characteristics and particularities of each logic component are definitively lost Returning to the first example combining a sequent calculus with an axiomatic system a better solution was proposed in Cruz Filipe et al the idea is to define an abstract formalism for proof systems general enough as to encode the main proof mechanisms found in the literature Thus after reformulating cal L and cal L as abstract proof systems of this kind the resulting combined logic cal L is an abstract proof system in which it is possible to recognize the genetic traces of the original inference rules of each component within derivations in cal L The latter question namely how to characterize derivations in a fibred logic in terms of the derivations of the components was carefully analyzed by S Marcelino et al in a series of papers Marcelino et al Marcelino and Caleiro Marcelino and Caleiro a and Caleiro and Marcelino See subsection Despite the above mentioned results on combining heterogeneous logics it seems more reasonable to combine logics defined in a homogeneous way and in fact this is the case with most of the proposals in the literature For instance the usual combinations of modal logics as fusion product and fibring are performed between systems presented axiomatically or between classes of Kripke models It is frequent therefore to define different categories of logic systems consequence relations Hilbert calculi algebraizable logics etc with appropriate morphisms between them in which the combination or decomposition of logics appear as universal constructions Algebraic fibring to be described in subsection is a good example of this approach The method of fusion of normal modal logics was introduced by R Thomason and constitutes one of the first general methods for combining logics In the original formulation it combines normal modal logics presented syntactically and semantically through Hilbert style axioms and Kripke semantics respectively The main characteristics of the method are described in the following paragraphs Consider Kripke models of the form langle W R V rangle such that W is a non empty set the set of worlds R subseteq W times W is a binary relation the accessibility relation and V mathbb P to wp W from the set of propositional variables into the power set of W is a valuation map Let cal L and cal L be two propositional normal modal logics defined over the same classical signature which contains the connectives neg negation and to implication Denote by square and square the necessity operators of cal L and cal L respectively Let cal M and cal M be the classes of Kripke models for cal L and cal L respectively Since both logics are normal it is granted that both modalities square and square satisfy the axiom K and the necessitation rule The fusion of cal L and cal L is then defined to be the normal bimodal logic cal L with two independent boxes square and square together with the connectives neg negation and to implication The semantics of cal L is given by the class cal M of Kripke structures of the form langle W R R V rangle such that langle W R V rangle and langle W R V rangle belong to cal M and cal M respectively In other words each structure of the fusion corresponds to a pair of models a model langle W R V rangle for cal L and a model langle W R V rangle for cal L sharing the same set of worlds W Technically speaking each structure of the fusion have as a reduct a model of cal L and a model of cal L Given a structure M langle W R R V rangle the accessibility relation R is used to evaluate the box square whereas R is used to evaluate square Since the language of cal L is freely generated by the union of the signatures of cal L and cal L it contains mixed formulas such as varphi square square p to p Now the structure M satisfies varphi above at a world w in W if and only if for every w in W such that w R w M satisfies square p to p at w But this means that either there exists w such that w R w and w not in V p or w in V p What concerns axiomatics a Hilbert calculus for cal L is obtained by joining up the schema axioms of both systems Thus cal L has among others two K axioms two necessitation rules and just one modus ponens because implication to is shared Considering that the language of cal L has mixed formulas as varphi above schema variables occurring in the schema rules of the given logics can now be replaced in cal L by mixed formulas For instance varphi can be derived in cal L from the formula square p to p by an application of the necessitation rule for the box square An interesting example of fusion appears in Schurz when an alethic deontic logic is defined by fusing a pure alethic logic with a pure deontic logic This combination is used to analyze Hume s is ought thesis see section above in formal terms Other intuitively appealing examples of fusion are given in the pioneering paper Fitting by M Fitting where alethic and deontic modalities are fused before the concept of fusion had ever been introduced Since then fusion has been a much worked theme Important results are the applications of fusion to simulations and to the question of transfer of properties among modal logics Simulations make the strength of normal monomodal logics explicit as they can in a sense simulate all modal logics see Kracht and Wolter With respect to transfers the preservation of properties such as completeness finite modal property decidability and interpolation by fusion of modal logics was extensively studied in Fine and Schurz More general and deeper results in the same spirit were obtained in Kracht and Wolter and a survey of most of those results can be found in Kracht and Wolter These results show the robustness of fusion as a combination method within the scope of modal logics for fulfilling the requirement of preserving the properties of the logics being combined The question of how completeness results and other model theoretical properties can be transferred from a propositional modal logic to its quantificational counterpart and from a monomodal quantified modal logic to their multimodal combinations by means of fusion is investigated in Schurz The paper also deals with the question on how completeness can be transferred from quantified modal logic with rigid designators to the ones with non rigid designators Rasga et al defines a categorical approach of fusion for modal logic systems labeled with truth values and it is shown that the preservation of completeness requires some careful assumptions while soundness is preserved without further provisos A wide variety of logics besides modal logics including several non classical logics can be treated in this way An interesting note is that there is a notable difference between combining logics from the syntactical and from the semantical perspective For instance the joining of two Hilbert calculi should be intuitively obtained by simply putting together the axioms and rules of both logics while the semantical counterpart is not so obviously determined Regarding this an alternative to fusion is the fibred semantics see subsection Fusion even if it is a very natural method for combining modal logics however is not obviously extendable to combinations of non normal modal logics with normal modal logics In Roggia Subsection the concept of fusion was generalized from normal modal logics to a broader class of labeled logical systems called relational LSLTV This was achieved through a categorical description of fusion as defined in Rasga et al In Chapter of Roggia an example of the fusion of non normal modal logics was provided by combining the non normal partition logic introduced in Fajardo and Finger with itself Despite this development which is strongly based on the notion of labeled deduction systems extending fusion to logical systems of a different nature is by no means straightforward Algebraic fibring described in subsection below constitutes a generalization of fusion at the propositional level and generally addresses the problem of combining logics Another early method for combining modal logics is the so called product of modal logics This mechanism independently introduced in Segerberg and in ehtman is appropriate to represent time space information Given two modal logics cal L and cal L as above the product cal L times cal L is the bimodal logic over the mixed signature endowed with two boxes characterized by the class of Kripke structures of the form langle W times W S S V times V rangle defined from Kripke models langle W R V rangle and langle W R V rangle for cal L and cal L respectively The accessibility relations S S subseteq W times W times W times W are defined as follows langle u u rangle S langle w w rangle iff u R w and u w langle u u rangle S langle w w rangle iff u R w and u w V times V p V p times V p A somewhat surprising feature of the product of modal logics is that some new interactions between modalities arise These new valid formulas are a sort of bridge principles recall section Using the standard notation lozenge varphi for neg square neg varphi and analogously for lozenge for the possibility operator the following bridge principles are always valid in the product logic lozenge lozenge p to lozenge lozenge p Commutativity lozenge lozenge p to lozenge lozenge p Commutativity lozenge square p to square lozenge p Church Rosser property lozenge square p to square lozenge p Church Rosser property Due to such interactions it is not possible to directly obtain the Hilbert calculus for the product of two modal logics as in the case of fusion The bridge principles must be explicitly added to the union of the original axiomatics in order to ensure completeness In general the axiomatization of products of modal logics is a delicate issue and some interesting phenomena can arise For instance the two dimensional modal product logic S times S has a finite axiomatization but for n geq the n dimensional product logic S n is non finitely axiomatizable In Kurucz and Marcelino there were found the first examples of decidable two dimensional products of finitely axiomatizable modal logics such as K times S which fail to be finitely axiomatizable These are examples of logics that fall prey to what we may call the finite crash phenomenon where the finite axiomatizability property is destroyed under the action of products The problem of finding a canonical axiomatization for non finitely axiomatizable products of finitely axiomatizable logics was solved in Hampson Kikot Kurucz and Marcelino by analyzing two dimensional modal product logics involving the unimodal logic of the difference Diff introduced by von Wright as the logic of elsewhere This logic is defined by the set of unimodal formulas that are valid in all the frames langle W neq W rangle where neq W is the non identity relation on a non empty set W these frames are called difference frames The logic Diff can be characterized as the logic of all the frames langle W R rangle where R is a pseudo equivalence relation that is where R is symmetric and pseudo transitive if R x y and R y z then either x z or R x z Since in particular equivalence relations are frames for Diff the latter is a sublogic of S The paper proves that despite Diff being a finitely axiomatizable subsystem of S the two dimensional product logic Diff times Diff is non finitely axiomatizable and can be axiomatized by infinitely many Sahlqvist axioms Let Diff times sq Diff be the square version of Diff times Diff which is characterized by the family of all the products langle U neq U rangle times langle V neq V rangle of difference frames such that the sets U and V have the same cardinality hence Diff times sq Diff contains the logic Diff times Diff The paper proves that the former is not a finite axiomatic extension of the latter and can be axiomatized by adding infinitely many Sahlqvist axioms The modal logics Diff times Diff and Diff times sq Diff are the first examples of products of finitely axiomatizable modal logics that are not finitely axiomatizable although axiomatizable by explicit infinite sets of canonical Sahlqvist axioms As in the case of fusion the technique of products of logics does not allow a direct generalization to logics other than modal ones The fibred semantics of modal logics was originally proposed in Gabbay a and Gabbay b see also Gabbay As in the case of fusion and products the mechanism of fibring also applies to modal logics only Assume the same notation as in subsection Thus given cal L and cal L we start by defining the fibred language or the fibring of the languages which is the language generated by square square neg and to from the propositional variables The basic idea is to consider Kripke models with distinguished actual worlds together with two transfer mappings h from the set of worlds of the class of models cal M of cal L into the class of models cal M of cal L and h from the set of worlds of the class of models cal M of cal L into the class of models cal M of cal L When a Kripke model of cal L has to evaluate a formula of the form square varphi at the actual world w the validity checking is then transferred to the validity checking of square varphi within the Kripke model h w at its actual world The evaluation of a formula of the form square varphi within a Kripke model of cal L at the actual world w is performed analogously but now using the map h Thus the fibring or fibring by functions as it is called in Carnielli et al of cal L and cal L is a normal bimodal logic characterized semantically as follows Let and be a pair of transfer mappings For simplicity we assume that the sets of worlds W m of m in cal M are pairwise disjoints and the same holds for cal M Given m in cal M cup cal M w in W m and a formula varphi in the fibred language the satisfaction of varphi in langle h h m w rangle denoted by langle h h m w rangle Vdash varphi is defined recursively as usual whenever the main connective of varphi is Boolean neg or to or when varphi is atomic For the modalities satisfaction is defined as follows Suppose without loss of generality that m in cal M and let h w langle m w rangle with m langle W m R m V m rangle and m langle W m R m V m rangle Then langle h h m w rangle Vdash square varphi iff langle h h m w rangle Vdash varphi for every w such that w R m w langle h h m w rangle Vdash square varphi iff langle h h m w rangle Vdash square varphi iff langle h h m w rangle Vdash varphi for every w such that w R m w The definition of langle h h m w rangle Vdash square i varphi for i and m in cal M is analogous Then langle h h rangle satisfies varphi denoted by langle h h rangle Vdash varphi if langle h h m w rangle Vdash varphi for every m in cal M cup cal M and w in W m Finally varphi is valid in the fibred semantics whenever langle h h rangle Vdash varphi for every pair langle h h rangle as above For instance given h h as above let langle W R V rangle in cal M and w in W such that h w langle langle W R V rangle w rangle Then langle h h langle W R V rangle w rangle Vdash square square neg p iff langle h h langle W R V rangle w rangle Vdash square square neg p iff langle h h langle W R V rangle w rangle Vdash square neg p for every w such that w R w Suppose that h w langle langle W R V rangle w rangle Then the latter is valid iff langle h h langle W R V rangle w rangle Vdash square neg p for every w such that w R w i e for every w such that w R w and for every w such that w R w langle h h langle W R V rangle w rangle Vdash neg p This is equivalent to saying that for every w such that w R w and for every w such that w R w w not in V p With respect to axiomatics the logics obtained by fibring by functions can in some cases be axiomatized by the union of the axioms schemas of the given logics But some logics may require the addition of some new bridge principles mixing rules and axioms in order to ensure the preservation of completeness This may explain some discrepancy between the approaches of fusion and fibring the completeness of fibring as exposed in Gabbay does not work exactly as a substitute for more technically intricate completeness proofs as in Kracht and Wolter and in Fine and Schurz For more on this discussion see Kracht The technique of fibring by functions is an interesting alternative to fusion and products but as much as its competitors it cannot be extended to non modal logics in any obvious way see Coniglio and Fern ndez for an adaptation of the method of fibring by functions to matrix logics One reason for the failure of fibring by functions to what concerns generalizations is that it is not a universal construction in categorial terms Moreover the lack of a systematic definition of the axiomatization for the logics obtained by fibring is another negative aspect of this technique The next subsection describes a categorial generalization of fibring which solves all the mentioned problems In order to overcome the limitations of the original method of fibring as exposed in the last subsection A Sernadas and collaborators propose in Sernadas et al a general definition of fibring using the conceptual tools of category theory The central idea of the generalization is simple suppose that cal L and cal L are two propositional logics which are to be combined Suppose for simplicity that no connectives are to be shared that is the language of the logic cal L to be obtained is the free combination of the connectives of both logics In categorial terms the signature C of cal L is the coproduct disjoint union of the signatures C of cal L and C of cal L in the underlying category of signatures Then cal L which is the least logic defined over C which extends simultaneously cal L and cal L is defined as the coproduct of cal L and cal L in the underlying category of logics The minimality of cal L attends a criterion expressed in Gabbay see also section and also conforms to the ideal of fusing logics see Kracht and Wolter This combination process called unconstrained fibring can be generalized by allowing C and C to share some connectives Thus the logic obtained by this second kind of fibring is defined in a language such that some connectives of cal L and cal L are identified The logic produced by this operation called constrained fibring starts by considering two logics cal L and cal L over signatures C and C respectively and a signature C contained in both C and C This signature contains exactly the connectives of cal L and cal L which are to be identified or shared throughout the combination process After computing the unconstrained fibring that is the coproduct cal L oplus cal L of cal L and cal L which is defined over the signature C oplus C the coproduct of C and C a new logic cal L is obtained This logic the fibring of cal L and cal L by sharing or constrained to C is obtained from cal L oplus cal L by identifying two connectives of the same arity iff both come from the same connective in C In terms of category theory it is required that the forgetful functor N from the category of logics to the category of signatures be a cofibration Then if i j cal C to C j is the inclusion morphism for j h j C j to C oplus C is the canonical injection of the coproduct for j and q C oplus C to C is the coequalizer of h circ i and h circ i then the constrained fibring cal L is the codomain of the cocartesian lifting of q by N In order to exemplify the technique of categorial fibring without entering into technical details suppose that cal L and cal L are two modal logics defined through Hilbert calculi over the same signatures C and C of subsections and respectively such that both logics contain the rules of modus ponens and necessitation Then C oplus C consists of two negations neg and neg two implications to and to and two boxes square and square The unconstrained fibring cal L oplus cal L of cal L and cal L is therefore the Hilbert calculus over C oplus C defined by joining up the axiom schemas and inference rules of both calculi This logic has among other axioms and inference rules two versions of modus ponens one for each implication as well as two versions of the necessitation rule one for each box It should be noted that by using a fixed set of schema variables for writing the axioms and rules of every calculus the calculi obtained by fibring are also formed by schematic axioms and inference rules Thus for instance in the rule of modus ponens in cal L frac xi hspace cm xi to xi xi the schema variables xi and xi can be replaced by mixed formulas Instances such as frac neg p hspace cm neg p to square q to square r square q to square r are new because the formulas neg p and square q to square r do not belong to the language of cal L Analogous replacements apply of course to other inference rules and axioms of cal L oplus cal L Continuing with this example suppose now that we want to share or identify both negations as well as both implications which is a reasonable move when for instance these connectives are classical In such case varphi to neg psi would represent the same proposition as varphi to neg psi In order to do this the signature C just containing neg and to is taken into consideration and so neg is identified with neg in C oplus C as well as to is identified with to The resulting signature is C which just contains the connectives neg to square and square In the resulting logic cal L defined over C there is now just one rule of modus ponens However there remain two necessitation rules since there are still two boxes in C The resulting cal L is thus the fibring of cal L and cal L constrained by C This procedure precisely coincides with fusion of modal logics The novelty here is that this technique applies to a broad class of logics which are not necessarily restricted to normal modal logics as in the case of fusion Constrained and unconstrained fibring being categorial are universal constructions and so enjoy well defined and theoretically predictable formal properties Profiting from universal constructions in order to handle algebraic fibring it is enough to define appropriate categories of signatures and logic systems Indeed the same fibring construction coproduct or cocartesian lifting can be performed in different categories of logic systems This is a remarkable advantage of the categorial perspective for fibring There are several proposals in the literature devoted to combining logics presented in different ways by means of algebraic fibring such as propositional Hilbert calculi sequent and hypersequent calculi first order modal logics higher order modal logics non truth functional logics logics semantically presented through ordered algebras encompassing generalized Kripke models etc An important question connected to combination of logics and in particular to algebraic fibring is the preservation of metaproperties such as completeness interpolation etc For instance when cal L and cal L are complete logic systems presented both semantically and syntactically under which condition is their fibring also complete In this regard Zanardo et al and Sernadas et al a give a partial solution to this question The preservation of soundness and completeness with respect to the technique of importing logics see subsection was proved in Rasga et al Besides in a series of papers Marcelino et al Marcelino and Caleiro Marcelino and Caleiro a and Caleiro and Marcelino S Marcelino et al study the preservation of decidability by unconstrained fibring that is by algebraic fibring without sharing connectives The key result is a general characterization of the derivations in the system obtained by fibring in terms of the derivations in each component The complexity of the decision procedures was also analyzed in these papers Thus it was shown that the decision problem for the fibred logic can be reduced polynomially to the worst decision problem of the given logics This means that in particular if the decision problems for two given logics cal L and cal L are both in a complexity class mathcal C then the decision problem for the unconstrained fibring cal L oplus cal L is also in mathcal C provided that mathcal C contains the basic complexity class P also known as PTIME and is closed for composition with polynomials Additional results on decidability and complexity of combined logics can be found in Caleiro and Marcelino Other examples of preservation of metaproperties are provided by the mechanism for combining logics known as meet combination of logics introduced by Sernadas et al see subsection Specifically the preservation of soundness and completeness see Sernadas et al Craig interpolation see C Sernadas et al and admissibility of rules see Rasga et al have been obtained for this method On the other hand transfer results have been extensively studied in the case of fusion of modal logics as already mentioned in subsection Besides the studies concerning preservation of metaproperties by fibring mentioned above the semantics of fibred logics is not so easy to determine from the semantics of the components That is there is no natural correspondence between the models of the component logics and the class of models which characterizes the least logic in the mixed language which extends simultaneously the given logics that is their fibring This question is far from being simple for instance in Marcelino and Caleiro a it was shown that the act of fibring two logics each of one being characterized by a single finite matrix can produce a logic which is uncharacterizable by a single matrix even infinite In Marcelino and Caleiro b a first step towards the solution of this problem was given by characterizing the semantics of unconstrained fibring of logics presented by means of nondeterministic matrix semantics Nondeterministic matrices or Nmatrices generalize logical matrices by allowing the connectives to be interpreted by multivalued truth functions instead of ordinary truth functions Nmatrices were formally introduced in Avron and Lev see also Avron and Lev to provide a semantical account for logics uncharacterizable by a single finite matrix However the use of Nmatrices for logics was already considered by several authors Rescher Ivlev and Kearns in the context of modal logics and Crawford and Etherington By using two different notions of product of Nmatrices strict product and omega power in Marcelino and Caleiro b it is shown that the disjoint fibring of two propositional logics each of one presented by a single Nmatrix is characterized by a single Nmatrix obtained from the given ones by using these products This encompasses the disjoint fibring of logics presented by matrices since every logical matrix is in particular a non deterministic matrix In Caleiro and Marcelino these products were extended in order to define the fibring of two logics by sharing connectives This goal was obtained by considering logics characterized by partial Nmatrices PNmatrices for short i e Nmatrices in which some entries of the truth tables can be empty sets However when dealing with standard Tarskian logics which by definition have single conclusion consequence relations it is required to consider omega powers of the corresponding PNmatrices which are infinite structures An alternative proposal to the problem of combining two logics characterized by finite valued Nmatrices by means of fibring even by sharing connectives was given in Coniglio That proposal is based on the notion of swap structures which is an analytical way to describe Nmatrices In its simpler form a swap structure is a finite valued Nmatrix in which its domain is formed by n tuples called snapshots describing the state of a formula varphi in terms of values assigned to varphi psi varphi ldots psi n varphi where each psi i p is a formula depending on a single propositional variable p The multioperators of the swap structures are described by means of Boolean functions or relations on the components of the snapshots In Coniglio it is shown that under certain conditions including that the logics being combined contain propositional classical logic the constrained fibring of two logics characterized by finite valued swap structures is a logic also characterized by a finite valued swap structure naturally obtained from the given ones by concatenating the conditions on the snapshots in a process called superposition of snapshots The relationship between fusion and algebraic fibring deserves some comments When restricted to modal propositional logics fusion is a particular case of algebraic fibring in the category of interpretation systems where logics are presented through ordered algebras because it is enough to consider interpretation systems defined over power set algebras induced by Kripke models At the syntactical level fusion is also a particular case of algebraic fibring in the category of Hilbert calculi in the realm of propositional signatures As much as first order modal logics are concerned the approaches diverge mainly because there are different semantical accounts for treating first order modalities For instance the semantical approach to modal first order logics by Sernadas et al a in the context of algebraic fibring differs from that of Kracht and Kutz in the context of fusion The fact that algebraic fibring generalizes at least at the propositional level the fusion of modal logics makes the former method become very natural and useful Moreover the universality of the construction allows one to define algebraic fibring in very different logical contexts categories of logics such as non truth functional logics higher order logics sequent calculi etc As it will be shown in section the different notions of morphisms between logics affect the strength of the logics obtained by algebraic fibring in the different categories of logic systems For general accounts of algebraic fibring see for instance Caleiro et al and Carnielli et al The methods for combining logics described above adhere to the splicing methodology in that they are used to combine logics creating new systems which extend the given logics As mentioned in section there is a converse direction namely the splitting methodology in which a given logic system is decomposed into other systems The possible translations semantics in short PTS introduced in Carnielli see also Carnielli is one of the few supporters of this viewpoint The notion of PTS was originally defined as an attempt to endow certain logics with recursive and palatable semantic interpretations Actually several paraconsistent logics which are not characterizable by finite matrices can be characterized by suitable combinations of many valued logics The idea of the decomposition is quite natural Given a logic cal L presented as a pair cal L langle C vdash cal L rangle in which C is a signature and vdash cal L is a consequence relation a family of translations f i L C to L C i for i in I is taken into consideration Here L C and L C i denote the algebra of formulas defined by the signature C and C i respectively Recall that a translation from a logic cal L into a logic cal L is a mapping f between the respective sets of formulas which preserve derivability that is Gamma vdash cal L varphi in the source logic cal L implies that f Gamma vdash cal L f varphi in the target logic cal L A pair P langle cal L i i in I f i i in I rangle as above is called a possible translations frame for cal L We say that P is a possible translations semantics for cal L if for every Gamma cup varphi subseteq L C Gamma vdash cal L varphi textrm iff f i Gamma vdash cal L i f i varphi textrm for every i in I This means that checking derivability in cal L is equivalent to checking derivability in every factor logic cal L i through the translations In many cases the factor logics cal L i are presented by finite matrices Since the length of a formula is finite it is enough to test a finite number of translations in order to determine if a formula of cal L is valid in cal L Thus checking the validity of a formula of cal L is equivalent to performing a finite number of finitary tests This decidability property is of real advantage when the original logic cal L is not characterizable by finite matrices For instance in Carnielli see also Marcos the well know hierarchy cal C n n in mathbb N of paraconsistent logics of N da Costa formed by logics which cannot be characterized by finite matrices is represented by means of a PTS whose factors are presented through finite matrices this grants a decision procedure for each logic cal C n In order to exemplify the concept of PTS as a splitting methodology consider the paraconsistent logic bC introduced in Carnielli and Marcos This logic is in particular a logic of formal inconsistency LFI in the sense that there exists a unary connective circ expressing the consistency of a formula Thus from varphi and neg varphi does not follow in general an arbitrary formula psi However varphi neg varphi circ varphi entails any formula psi The signature C of bC consists of a paraconsistent negation neg a consistency operator circ and classical connectives wedge vee to It was proved in Carnielli et al that bC and many other logics of formal inconsistency extending it cannot be characterized by finite matrices Nonetheless bC is decomposed into several copies of a three valued logic by means of possible translations as follows Consider the signature C neg neg circ circ circ wedge vee to consisting of two negations three consistency operators a conjunction a disjunction and an implication Let M be the matrix over C with domain T t F displayed below where T t is the set of designated values Let f i i in I be the family of all the mappings f L C to L C satisfying clauses tr tr tr tr and tr below The family of mappings f i i in I can be shown to define a PTS which characterizes bC in a decidable way see Carnielli et al As an example it can be easily checked that varphi wedge neg varphi to neg circ varphi is a theorem of bC just consider all its finitely many translations and test that all of them are three valued tautologies On the other hand neg varphi wedge neg varphi to circ varphi is not a theorem of bC which can be promptly verified by showing that at least one of its translations is not a tautology using the three valued tables above For an alternative PTS characterization of bC and related logics see Marcos This example shows that a non truth functional connective such as the paraconsistent negation neg or the consistency operator circ of bC can be mimicked by interpreting it via translations into different truth functional connectives The idea of interpreting or decomposing a connective into simpler ones can be related to the notion of non deterministic matrix semantics proposed by Avron and Lev and mentioned in subsection Indeed in Carnielli and Coniglio it is shown that non deterministic matrices can be simulated by appropriate possible translations semantics In particular the familiar matrix semantics are a particular case of possible translations semantics as well as the historical examples of translations between logics found in the literature These facts evidence that possible translations semantics is a widely applicable conceptual tool for decomposing logics Apart from the logical and philosophical import of combining logics there is a genuine interest in developing applications based on these techniques One of the main areas interested in the methods for combining logics is software specification Certain techniques for combining logics were developed almost exclusively with the aim of applying them to this area In this section some of these methods will be briefly mentioned namely temporalization parameterization and institutions Temporalization was introduced in Finger and Gabbay see also Finger and Gabbay and generalized in Caleiro et al towards the method called parameterization Parameterization in rough terms consists of replacing the atomic part of a given logic cal L by another logic cal L Thus the logic cal L is the parameterized logic the atomic part is the formal parameter and the logic cal L is the parameter logic Formally a mixed signature based on the signature of cal L is considered to which the formulas of cal L are added as constants In the particular case of temporalization the parameter logic is a temporal logic In turn it can be proven that parameterization is a particular case of constrained fibring recall subsection The method can be explained by means of a simple example taken from Carnielli et al consider a propositional modal logic cal L to be parameterized with first order logic cal L fol in order to describe the dynamics of data bases The resulting logic is defined in a language whose formulas are obtained by replacing propositional constants in formulas of cal L by first order formulas That is modalities can be freely used but quantifiers cannot be applied to modal formulas other propositional connectives such as negation and implication are shared The semantic structures for the new logic are Kripke structures where the valuation for propositional constants is replaced by a kind of zooming in mapping in the sense of Blackburn and de Rijke associating a first order semantic structure together with a fixed assignment for individual variables to each state The deductive system for the new logic is formed by the rules of both logics The rules of cal L can be instantiated with formulas of the parameterized language but the rules of first order logic can only be applied to pure first order formulas One important difference between parameterization in particular temporalization and constrained fibring is the degree of symmetry the parameterized language and inference rules are intrinsically asymmetric while this is not the case of constrained fibring Institutions were introduced by J Goguen and R Burstall see Goguen and Burstall as a kind of abstract model theory for computer science and are adequate for developing concepts of specification languages such as structuring of specifications and implementation The theory of institutions is mainly applicable to software specification defined by multiple logical systems see for instance Diaconescu and Futatsugi Thus under an abstract view of software development different components of the same program can be specified using different formalism in a heterogeneous setting This is formalized by the use of institutions and morphisms between them see for instance Tarlecki A problem concerning institution morphisms is that formulas involving connectives from different logics being combined are not allowed A solution to this problem was proposed in Goguen and Burstall and Mossakowski by using the so called parchments and parchment morphisms Despite the fact that algebraic fibring is suitable for combining an ample class of logic systems some kinds of logics namely substructural logics such as linear logic and logics equipped with a nondeterministic semantics lie outside the scope of this combination method Moreover at the semantical level algebraic fibring by its own nature does not make possible to keep representatives of all the models of the original logics which leads to the collapsing problem of fibring see section With the aim of still enlarging the range of application of algebraic fibring so as to make it able to deal with substructural logics and with logics endowed with nondeterministic semantics as well as to combine pointwise models of each logic a formalism for representing logics and their combinations based on the general notion of multi graphs or for short m graphs was proposed by A Sernadas and his collaborators see Sernadas et al a b Multi graphs are graphs where the source of each edge is a finite sequence of nodes instead of a unique node Concerning signatures the nodes of the m graph are seen as sorts and the m edges are seen as language constructors From the semantical viewpoint nodes are truth values and m edges are relations between truth values Finally concerning deductive systems nodes are language expressions and m edges are inference rules The fibring of logics described by m graphs a k a graph theoretic fibring is defined by pointwise combining models of each combined logic in contrast to the usual notion of semantic fibring in which entire classes of models are combined This allows one to avoid the collapsing problem see the next section in a very natural way As an immediate application of this graph theoretic setting the preservation of the finite model property by graph theoretic fibring was proved in Coniglio et al Since under reasonable conditions the finite model property entails decidability this result is particularly useful Another application of the graph theoretic account of logic is the definition of an asymmetric combination technique called importing logics see Rasga et al Temporalization as well as its generalization modalization see Fajardo and Finger and Finger and Weiss are particular cases of importing logics Under this approach the combined language is endowed with an explicit constructor called importing connective which transforms formulas of the imported logic into formulas of the importing logic This is the main difference between the technique of importing logics and the related technique of parameterization which also generalizes temporalization see subsection Semantically each model of the resulting logic obtained by the method of importing logics is a pair composed of a model of the importing logic and a model of the imported logic plus the interpretation of the importing connective In Rasga et al a new formulation of algebraic fibring called biporting was introduced which turns out to be equivalent to the original one From this it is possible to prove that some particular cases of importing like temporalization modalization and globalization are subsumed by fibring A new mechanism for combining logics called meet combination of logics was firstly presented in C Sernadas et al and additionally developed in Rasga et al This technique is based on the idea of melding or pairing connectives of the same arity of two given logics being combined The melded connectives of the resulting logic inherit the common properties enjoyed in both logics instead of the union of their properties as it occurs in the case of the shared connectives of constrained fibring The idea of pairing connectives within a single logic was already explored in Sernadas et al a and b towards identifying common properties of any given pair of connectives of the same arity Up to this point several techniques for composing logics have been described and exemplified Are these processes appropriate for composing without surprises any pair of logics In other words given a pair of logics presented in a homogeneous way are they composable in a meaningful way Does the composition make philosophical sense As pointed out by Schurz it is conceivable that some multimodal logics obtained as a combination of modal logics by adding arbitrarily chosen bridge principles could be worthless From the technical point of view there is an important problem concerning composition of logics known as collapsing problem firstly identified in Gabbay b where he pointed to the difficulty of the fibring methodology in combining classical and intuitionistic propositional logics CPL and IPL without avoiding the collapsing of the intuitionistic connectives into classical ones An explicit exhibition of this collapsing was given in del Cerro and Herzig where they study a logic called C J combining classical logic C and intuitionistic logic J By defining the semantics of C J in a natural way starting from a possible worlds semantics for J and adding the usual interpretation for classical implication and negation within any possible world they obtain on the axiomatic side the surprising result that the Hilbert axiomatization related to that semantics attained by simply joining the axioms of C and J plus some supplementary interaction axioms involving connectives from both collapses into classical logic They solve the problem by modifying the intuitionistic weakening axiom schema in a suitable way Previously Humberstone had already investigated the question of combining intuitionistic and classical logics independent from fibring techniques obtaining a completeness proof based on canonical models Basically the phenomenon pointed up by Gabbay arises because both implications collapse and then intuitionistic implication becomes classic From the algebraic semantical point of view it happens that the models of the fibred logic are Heyting algebras which are simultaneously Boolean algebras evidently the algebras collapse to the Boolean ones From the point of view of proof theory the problem appears as a direct consequence of the metaproperty called Deduction Metatheorem DMT let to and to be the intuitionistic and the classical implications respectively Then begin array lll Gamma varphi vdash psi textrm iff Gamma vdash varphi to psi Gamma varphi vdash psi textrm iff Gamma vdash varphi to psi end array Thus the following argument applies see Gabbay b begin array ll varphi to psi vdash varphi to psi textrm Axiom varphi to psi varphi vdash psi textrm DMT for rightarrow varphi to psi vdash varphi to psi textrm DMT for rightarrow end array A similar argument shows that varphi to psi vdash varphi to psi That is classical and intuitionistic implications collapse in the combined logic It is worth noting that the previous arguments depart from the very strong assumption that the metaproperty DMT is preserved in the combined logic As we shall see below this is not the case for algebraic fibring unless a stronger notion of morphism between logics is adopted Some alternatives to avoid the collapsing problem were proposed in the literature In C Sernadas et al b other examples of collapse were presented and a solution to the problem was proposed by means of a controlled notion of algebraic fibring called modulated fibring In turn Caleiro and Ramos proposed another extension of fibring at the semantical level by means of a technique called cryptofibring Using this tool a conservative extension of classical and intuitionistic logic is possible As mentioned in subsection the graph theoretic fibring leads to an additional solution to this problem Another solution to the collapsing problem was obtained by means of the meet combination of logics see subsection Given that the combined connectives inherit the common properties enjoyed in both logics the interaction between the component logics within the resulting logic is minimized which allows to overcome the collapsing problem In Toyooka and Sano the path of Humberstone and del Cerro and Herzig was retaken investigating a combined system of intuitionistic and classical propositional logic from proof theoretic viewpoints Based on the semantic treatment of Humberstone and del Cerro and Herzig the paper proposed a sequent calculus G C J for the combined logic By imposing restrictions on the right rule for intuitionistic implication it was shown that the calculus G C J enjoys cut elimination and Craig interpolation which entails the decidability of this combination The problem of combining classical and intuitionistic logic was analyzed from a philosophical and proof theoretical perspective by Prawitz when he introduced the important notion of ecumenical logics According to him it would be possible to define a combined system in which both kind of reasoning could be performed in a non conflictive way Thus an intuitionistic reasoner could recognize and tolerate the validity of an instance A vee c neg A of excluded middle with respect to the classical disjunction vee c In turn a classical logician should accept that A vee i neg A is not valid where vee i denotes the intuitionistic disjunction Moreover according to Prawitz Based on this perspective he presented a natural deduction calculus for a first order non collapsing combination of classical and intuitionistic logic in a language containing the classical logical constants vee c to c and exists c the intuitionistic logical constants vee i to i and exists i and the constants bot neg wedge and forall that are common to both logics He also considered predicates with subscripts i and c It is important to notice that classical logic is recovered just at the level of theorems and so in particular modus ponens does not hold as an inference rule for the classical implication to c This means that his system represents intuitionist logic as a host logic in which it is possible to consider classical claims in a way that for instance A vee c B is a representation under the intuitionistic perspective of neg neg A wedge neg B while A to c B is expressed as neg A wedge neg B A single conclusion sequent calculus for ecumenical first order logic was proposed in Pimentel et al It is worth noting that Girard already introduced a non collapsing sequent calculus called unified calculus LU for classical intuitionistic and linear logics Extension of Prawitz s ideas to the modal context were proposed in the literature Marin et al introduced a pure calculus for ecumenical modalities by means of a nested system with a stoup using a suitable notion of polarities for ecumenical formulas Following Prawitz s notion of ecumenical logic while there is only a necessity connective square there are two possibility operators the intuitionistic lozenge i and the classical lozenge c In this setting an intuitionistic modal logic plays the role of the host which is then expanded with classical connectives In turn Rasga and C Sernadas defined a non collapsing combination of classical modal logic S with propositional intuitionistic logic Their approach is different from the previous one since in this case the host of the combination process is classical modal logic S Besides this they adopt a simpler proof theoretic framework through a standard Gentzen calculus In this case conjunction disjunction and bottom are shared connectives while implication and the necessity operator have distinct intuitionistic and classical versions inducing two different negations in terms of bottom and the respective implications It is proven that the calculus enjoys cut elimination and it is sound and complete with respect to pure Kripke structures for S while accommodating intuitionistic connectives The combined system conservatively extends both intuitionistic and S modal logic Independently of the collapsing problem of classical and intuitionistic implication in Beziau it was observed that by putting together the sequent rules for classical conjunction and the rules for classical disjunction the resulting sequent calculus will unexpectedly prove the distributivity between conjunction and disjunction The same phenomenon occurs if we join the two valued valuation clauses for classical conjunction with the valuation clauses for classical disjunction However this is avoided by considering algebraic fibring in the usual categories Hilbert calculi or consequence relations with translations between logics as morphisms the logic obtained is the logic of lattices which does not satisfy distributivity see Beziau and Coniglio This situation in which new interaction rules between the connectives arise is arguably undesirable In fact it contradicts a basic criterion of fibring and also of fusion as expressed in Gabbay given logic systems cal L and cal L the combination of cal L and cal L should be the smallest logic system in the combined language which is a conservative extension of both cal L and cal L Indeed the distributivity problem and the collapsing problem are two instances of the same phenomenon of emergence of unexpected interactions such as bridge principles between connectives caused by combination processes In the case of combination of conjunction with disjunction the distributive law emerges This interaction is due to the combination process and appears without any apparent reason In turn the collapsing problem is a limit case of interactions because the interderivability between classical and intuitionistic implication nothing else than two interaction laws between different connectives is also spontaneously created by the combination process It can be argued that the combined logics are excessively strong in such cases because they derive too many propositions in the new combined language On the other hand the opposite or dual situation may also be problematic suppose to help intuition that the logic of classical negation is combined with the logic of classical disjunction These logics can be presented for instance axiomatically through Hilbert calculi or semantically say through valuations over that is by means of classical truth tables The semantical presentation of the logic of classical negation consists of the set of all valuations over satisfying the following clause v neg varphi textrm iff v varphi On the other hand the logic of classical disjunction can be characterized by the set of all valuations over such that v varphi vee psi textrm iff v varphi textrm and v psi As a consequence the combined logic of negation and disjunction which can be defined as the logic over neg and vee characterized by the valuations over satisfying both clauses above validates varphi vee neg varphi and so classical logic is recovered This is the result obtained by the combination method called direct union of matrices introduced in Coniglio and Fern ndez However if algebraic fibring is considered in categories such as those of Hilbert calculi or consequence relations the combination between the logic of negation and the logic of disjunction results in a logic defined over neg and vee which is weaker than classical logic In particular the interaction law varphi vee neg varphi is no longer valid That is an arguably desirable interaction between the connectives is lost in the combination process and classical logic expressed over neg and vee cannot be recovered from its fragments as long as algebraic fibring in these categories of logics is used Another example of the same kind is the following the algebraic fibring between the logic of classical negation neg and the logic of classical implication to regarded in the categories above does not recover classical logic expressed over neg and to Indeed the resulting logic system defined over neg and to cannot validate Ex Contradictione Sequitur Quodlibet when presented as an axiom not vdash varphi to neg varphi to psi Interestingly enough Ex Contradictione Sequitur Quodlibet presented as a derivation holds in the fibred logic varphi neg varphi vdash psi Observe that varphi to neg varphi to psi is an interaction rule between the connectives of the logics being combined which cannot be obtained by algebraic fibring in the categories under consideration However this principle can be recovered e g by direct union of matrices If one is interested in recovering a logic from its fragments this result is disappointing Concerning the study of the expressive power of the combination of fragments of classical logic mentioned above both at the axiomatic level as well as considered as subalgebras of the valued Boolean algebra Rautenberg obtained several interesting results in Rautenberg One of his main contributions was the proof that any valued matrix can be effectively axiomatized In turn the question of combination of fragments of classical logic by fibring was additionally investigated in Caleiro et al based on the description of the valued clones made in Post on the axiomatization procedures for valued matrices introduced in Rautenberg and on the results on fibring N matrices presented in Marcelino and Caleiro b see subsection In particular the paper studied the conditions under which the fibring of the Hilbert calculi of disjoint fragments of classical logic recovers the union of the fragments Several examples of combinations by fibring of the logics of classical connectives were analyzed obtaining their characterizations by N matrices as well as the additional inference rules bridge principles needed for recovering the corresponding fragment of classical logic Among several examples it was shown that the fibring of two copies of the logic of classical conjunction collapses into the logic of a single conjunction On the other hand neither the combination of two copies of the logic of the classical negation nor the combination of two copies of the logic of the classical disjunction produces an analogous collapse The fibring of two copies of the logic of classical negation is not finite valued but can be characterized by a valued Nmatrix and the fibring of two copies of the logic of classical disjunction cannot be characterized by a single finite valued Nmatrix By analyzing once again the combination by fibring of the logic of classical disjunction and the logic of classical conjunction that is the least conservative extension of both logics it was shown that the combined logic cannot be characterized by a single finite valued Nmatrix The same happens with the fibring of the logic of classical disjunction and the logic of classical negation thus showing that the fibred logics are strictly subclassical in both cases These examples as well as other along the same lines suggest a problem dual to that of collapsing and distributivity between conjunction and disjunction namely some expected interaction laws fail to be created by some combination processes In such cases it could be said that the combined logics are too weak because they are unable to derive certain intended propositions in the new combined language What could be expected when combining logics Strong logics guaranteeing for instance that a logic can be recovered from its fragments or weaker ones in which undesirable interactions between connectives are blocked The examples above are evidence against and in favor of both situations In order to avoid del Cerro and Herzig s collapsing problem a careful splicing process should be expected consequently eliminating the interaction between the two implications described above On the other hand if one wants to recover say classical logic from some of its fragments a more liberal splicing process would be more appropriate as some intended interactions between connectives of both logics would be recovered With respect to the distributivity problem when combining conjunction and disjunction the choice of method is also not determined distributivity could be a desired feature if we adopted the viewpoint of recovering a logic from its fragments In this case a combination method defining a stronger logic such as the direct union of matrices would be more appropriate than for instance algebraic fibring of Hilbert calculi But if as argued in Beziau distributivity is regarded as an intruder then a more cautious process would be recommended algebraic fibring of Hilbert calculi would be more appropriate in this case To sum up the choice of the most adequate combining process depends upon what one wants to obtain At this point it is convenient to notice that the question about whether or not interactive principles are generated when combining modal logics is intrinsically related to Hume s is ought problem discussed in section Indeed as proven in Schurz it is possible to obtain nontrivial is ought deductions in the combination of alethic and deontic logics provided that some bridge principles are allowed The validity of bridge principles as obcirc varphi rightarrow lozenge varphi is nothing else than interaction rules between connectives of the logics being combined Such principles enjoy a similar conceptual status as the distributivity laws between conjunction and disjunction or as the collapsing example mentioned above Thus in order to satisfy Hume s thesis a combination process generating logics without interactions should be preferred On the other hand a combination process allowing the creation of interactions between the connectives could grant bridge principles violating Hume s thesis Finally it is noteworthy to observe that algebraic fibring does not intrinsically forbid the emergence of interactions between connectives of the logics being combined In fact the notion of morphism in the category of logic systems being employed is the key to creating or blocking interactions In order to exemplify this assertion consider the case of the failure to recover classical logic from its neg fragment and vee fragment by algebraic fibring From a proof theoretic perspective the key reason for this failure is that the rule tag frac Gamma varphi vdash psi quad Delta neg varphi vdash psi Gamma Delta vdash psi of the logic of classical negation is not preserved by algebraic fibring in categories of logic systems having translations between logics as morphisms recall subsection such as the category of Hilbert calculi or consequence relations When considering algebraic fibring of classical implication with classical negation in those categories the missing rule is the Deduction Metatheorem tag frac Gamma varphi vdash psi Gamma vdash varphi to psi Categories of logic systems having logic translations as morphisms are such that the canonical injections of the coproduct are just inclusion mappings Then given two logics cal L and cal L the only rules of these logics which are preserved by algebraic fibring are those of the form Gamma vdash varphi On the other hand suppose that we are dealing with a category of logic systems in which the preservation of rules such as or above is required by the very notion of morphism Thus if a logic cal L is obtained as a combination of two other systems cal L and cal L then the rules of cal L and cal L would be faithfully transferred to cal L This is the proposal of Coniglio in which algebraic fibring in categories of sequent calculi is investigated taking into account a notion of morphism which preserves logical rules of the form textit If Gamma vdash varphi textit and and Gamma n vdash varphi n textit then Gamma vdash varphi In such categories when a logic system is embedded into a larger one by algebraic fibring any rule as above which can be considered as a meta theorem of the logic is preserved by the canonical injections This is why this process is called meta fibring From the categorial point of view the process is the same as for algebraic fibring the only difference being that the notion of morphism is stronger In Coniglio and Figallo Coniglio and Figallo extended the idea of meta fibring that is algebraic fibring of formal sequent calculi to hypersequents which allows preserving even stronger meta properties of the logics being combined Hypersequents which are finite multisets of ordinary sequents constitute a natural generalization of the proof method of sequents and turn out to be a suitable tool for presenting cut free Gentzen type formulations for several non classical logics These examples illustrate the advantages of using category theory and their tools for defining combination procedures as universal constructions The same construction in this case algebraic fibring can be performed in categories of logic systems with different features obtaining as a consequence of this stronger or weaker logic systems category theory God arguments for the existence of moral arguments Hume David

An epistemically justified belief is one that is properly held given the believer s perspective for the sake of believing the truth According to a coherence theory of epistemic justification also known as coherentism a belief is epistemically justified by cohering with other beliefs The nature of the coherence has been variously explained as is discussed below This coherentism is distinct from a coherence theory of truth that is a theory saying that a proposition is made true by being in some sort of coherent system Modern coherence theorists in contrast to some earlier writers in the British idealist tradition typically subscribe to a coherence theory of justification without advocating a coherence theory of truth Rather they either favor a correspondence theory of truth or take the notion of truth for granted at least for the purposes of their epistemological investigations This does not prevent many authors from claiming that coherence justification is an indication or criterion of truth A central problem in epistemology is to explain when we are justified in holding a proposition to be true It is not at all evident what epistemic justification is and classical accounts of that notion have turned out to be severely problematic A foundationalist tradition inspired by Descartes holds that justified beliefs are those that are either self evidently true or deduced from self evident truths But as is often argued little of what we take ourselves to justifiably believe satisfies these austere conditions many of our apparently justified beliefs it is commonly thought are neither based on self evident truths nor derivable in a strict logical sense from other things we believe in Thus the Cartesian rationalist picture of justification seems far too restrictive Similar problems hound empiricist attempts to ground all our knowledge in the allegedly indubitable data of the senses Depending on how they are understood sense data are either not indubitable or else not informative enough to justify a sufficient portion of our purported knowledge Cartesian foundationalism has its rivals There is another form of foundationalism according to which some beliefs have some non doxastic source of epistemic support that requires no support of its own This support can be defeasible and it can require supplementation to be strong enough for knowledge This sort of non doxastic support would terminate the regress of justification To do so it may not have to appeal to self evidence indubitability or certainty Such foundationalist views vary on the source of the non doxastic support how strong the support is on its own and what role in justification coherence plays if any This sort of foundationalism too has been criticized Some critics of this position have questioned the intelligibility of the non doxastic support relation Thus Davidson complains that advocates have been unable to explain the relation between experience and belief that allows the first to justify the second The difficulties pertaining to both rationalism and empiricism about justification have led many epistemologists to think that there must be something fundamentally wrong with the way in which the debate has been framed prompting their rejection of the foundationalist justificatory structure underlying rationalism and empiricism alike Rather than conceiving the structure of our knowledge on the model of Euclidean geometry with its basic axioms and derived theorems these epistemologists favor a holistic picture of justification which does not distinguish between basic or foundational and non basic or derived beliefs treating rather all our beliefs as equal members of a web of belief Quine and Ullian cf Neurath and Sosa The mere rejection of foundationalism is not itself an alternative theory because it leaves us with no positive account of justification save a suggestive metaphor about webs of belief A more substantial contrasting proposal is that what justifies our beliefs is ultimately the way in which they hang together or dovetail so as to produce a coherent set The fact that our beliefs cohere can establish their justification even though each individual belief may lack justification entirely if considered in splendid isolation or so it is thought Following C I Lewis some proponents think of this situation as analogous to how agreeing testimonies in court can lead to a verdict although each testimony by itself would be insufficient for that purpose There is a serious objection that any coherence theory of justification must immediately face It is called the isolation objection how can the mere fact that a system is coherent if the latter is understood as a purely system internal matter provide any guidance whatsoever to truth and reality Since a coherence theory in its basic form does not assign any essential role to experience there is little reason to think that a coherent system of belief will accurately reflect the external world A variation on this theme is presented by the equally notorious alternative systems objection For each coherent system of beliefs there exist conceivably other systems that are equally coherent yet incompatible with the first system If coherence is sufficient for justification then the beliefs in each of these incompatible systems would be justified if the system was believed But this observation of course thoroughly undermines any claim suggesting that coherence is indicative of truth As we shall see most if not all influential coherence theorists try to avoid these traditional objections by assigning some beliefs that are close to experience a special role whether they are called supposed facts asserted Lewis truth candidates Rescher cognitively spontaneous beliefs BonJour or something else Depending on how this special role is construed these theories are often classified as versions of weak foundationalism An advocate of weak foundationalism typically holds that while coherence is incapable of justifying beliefs from scratch it can provide justification for beliefs that already have some initial perhaps minuscule degree of warrant e g observational beliefs Historically foundationalist theories have been defended as solutions to a regress problem The next section will present that problem and describe how coherentists have responded to it A fair number of distinguished contemporary philosophers have declared that they advocate a coherence theory of justification Apart from this superficial fact these theories often address some rather diverse issues loosely united by the fact that they in one way or the other take a holistic approach to the justification of beliefs Here are some of the problems and questions that have attracted the attention of coherence theorists cf Bender The fact that these separate though related issues are not always clearly distinguished presents a challenge to the reader of the relevant literature Although the regress problem is not a central contemporary issue it is helpful to explain coherence theories as responses to the problem This will also serve to illustrate some challenges that a coherence theory faces We will then turn to the concept of coherence itself as that concept is traditionally conceived Unfortunately not all prominent authors associated with the coherence theory use the term coherence in this traditional sense and the section that follows is devoted to such non standard coherence theories The arguably most systematic and prolific discussion of the coherence theory of justification has focused on the relationship between coherence and probability The rest of this entry will be devoted to this development which took off in the mid s inspired by seminal work by C I Lewis The development has given us precise and sophisticated definitions of coherence as well as detailed studies of the relationship between coherence and truth probability culminating in some potentially disturbing impossibility results that shed doubt on the possibility of defining coherence in a way that makes it indicative of truth More precise descriptions of key entailments of these results and ways to address the worries that they raise will be discussed in later sections of this entry On the traditional justified true belief account of knowledge a person cannot be said to know that a proposition p is true without having good reasons for believing that p is true These good reasons would be justification for believing p If Lucy knows that she will pass tomorrow s exam she must have good reasons for thinking that this is so Consider now Lucy s reasons They will presumably consist of other beliefs she has e g beliefs about how well she did earlier about how well she has prepared and so on For Lucy to know that she will pass the exam these other beliefs upon which the first belief rests must also be things that Lucy knows Knowledge after all cannot be based on something less than knowledge i e on ignorance cf Rescher Since the reasons are themselves things that Lucy knows those reasons must in turn be based on reasons and so on Thus any knowledge claim requires a never ending chain or regress of reasons for reasons This seems strange or even impossible because it involves reference to an infinite number of beliefs We seem unable to have infinitely many beliefs much less justified ones But most of us think that knowledge is possible What is the coherentist s response to the regress The coherentist might be thought to propose that nothing prevents the regress from proceeding in a circle Thus A can be a reason for B which is a reason for C which is a reason for A If this is acceptable then what we have is a chain of reasons that is never ending but which does not involve an infinite number of beliefs It is never ending in the sense that for each belief in the chain there is a reason for that belief also in the chain Yet there is an immediate problem with this response due to the fact that justificatory circles are usually thought to be vicious ones If someone claims C and is asked why she believes it she may reply that her reason is B If asked why she believes B she may assert A But if prompted to justify her belief in A she is not allowed to refer back to C which in the present justificatory context is still in doubt If she did justify A in terms of C nonetheless her move would lack any justificatory force whatsoever The coherentist may respond by denying that she ever intended to suggest that circular reasoning is a legitimate dialectical strategy What she objects to is rather the assumption that justification should at all proceed in a linear fashion whereby reasons are given for reasons and so on This assumption of linearity presupposes that what is in a primary sense justified are individual beliefs This says the coherentist is simply wrong it is not individual beliefs that are primarily justified but entire belief systems Particular beliefs can also be justified but only in a secondary or derived sense if they form part of a justified belief system This is a coherence approach because what makes a belief system justified on this view is precisely its coherence A belief system is justified if it is coherent to a sufficiently high degree This in essence is Laurence BonJour s solution to the regress problem This looks much more promising than the circularity theory If epistemic justification is holistic in this sense then a central assumption behind the regress is indeed false and so the regress never gets started Even so this holistic approach raises many new questions to which the coherentist will need to respond First of all we need to get clearer on what the concept of coherence involves as that concept is applied to a belief system This is the topic of the next section Second the proposal that a singular belief is justified merely in virtue of being a member of a justified totality can be questioned because plausibly a belief can be a member of a sufficiently coherent system without in any way adding to the coherence of that system e g if the belief is the only member which does not quite fit in an otherwise strikingly coherent system Surely a belief will have to contribute to the coherence of the system in order to become justified by that system A particular belief needs in other words to cohere with the system of which it is a member if that belief is to be considered justified We will turn to this issue in section in connection with Keith Lehrer s epistemological work Finally we have seen that most coherence theories assign a special role to some beliefs that are close to experience in order to avoid the isolation and alternative systems objections This fact raises the question of what status those special beliefs have Do they have to have some credibility in themselves or can they be totally lacking therein A particularly clear debate on this topic is the Lewis BonJour controversy over the possibility of justification by coherence from scratch which we will examine more closely in section By a traditional account of coherence we will mean one which construes coherence as a relation of mutual support or agreement among given data propositions beliefs memories testimonies etc Early characterizations were given by among others Brand Blanshard and A C Ewing According to Ewing a coherent set is characterized partly by consistency and partly by the property that every belief in the set follows logically from the others taken together Thus a set such as A A A amp A if consistent is highly coherent on this view because each element follows by logical deduction from the rest in concert While Ewing s definition is admirably precise it defines coherence too narrowly Few belief sets that occur naturally in everyday life satisfy the austere second part of his definition the requirement that each element follow logically from the rest when combined Consider for instance the set consisting of propositions A B and C where This set is intuitively coherent and yet it fails to satisfy Ewing s second condition The proposition A for instance does not follow logically from B and C taken together that John owns a gun of the relevant type and deposited money in his bank the day after does not logically imply him being at the crime scene at the time of the crime Similarly neither B nor C follows from the rests of the propositions in the set by logic alone C I Lewis s definition of coherence or congruence to use his term can be seen as a refinement and improvement of Ewing s basic idea As Lewis defines the term a set of supposed facts asserted is coherent congruent just in case every element in the set is supported by all the other elements taken together whereby support is understood not in logical terms but in a probabilistic sense In other words P supports Q if and only if the probability of Q is raised on the assumption that P is true As is readily appreciated Lewis s definition is less restrictive than Ewing s more sets will turn out to be coherent on the former than on the latter There are some uninteresting limiting cases for which this is not true For instance a set of tautologies will be coherent in Ewing s but not in Lewis s sense since the probabiity of any tautology is maximal and cannot be raised These cases are not significant parts of anyone s actual body of beliefs Let us return to the example with John The proposition A while not logically entailed by B and C is under normal circumstances nevertheless supported by those propositions taken together If we assume that John owns the relevant type of gun and deposited a large sum the next day then this should raise the probability that John did it and thereby also raise the probability that he was at the crime scene when the robbery took place Similarly one could hold that each of B and C is supported in the probabilistic sense by the other elements of the set If so this set is not only coherent in an intuitive sense but also coherent according to Lewis s definition Against Lewis s proposal one could hold that it seems arbitrary to focus merely on the support single elements of a set receive from the rest of the set cf Bovens and Olsson Why not consider the support any subset not just singletons receives from the rest We will return to this question later in this entry Another influential proposal concerning how to define coherence originates from Laurence BonJour whose account is considerably more complex than earlier suggestions Where Ewing and Lewis proposed to define coherence in terms of one single concept logical consequence and probability respectively BonJour thinks that coherence is a concept with a multitude of different aspects corresponding to the following coherence criteria A difficulty pertaining to theories of coherence that construe coherence as a multidimensional concept is to specify how the different dimensions are to be amalgamated so as to produce an overall coherence judgment It could well happen that one system S is more coherent than another system T in one respect whereas T is more coherent than S in another Perhaps S contains more inferential connections than T but T is less anomalous than S If so which system is more coherent in an overall sense Bonjour s theory is largely silent on this point BonJour s account also raises another general issue The third criterion stipulates that the degree of coherence increases with the number of inferential connections between different parts of the system Now as a system grows larger the probability that there will be relatively many inferentially connected beliefs is increased simply because there are more possible connections to be made Hence one could expect there to be a positive correlation between the size of a system and the number of inferential connections between the beliefs contained in the system BonJour s third criterion taken at face value entails therefore that a bigger system will generally have a higher degree of coherence due to its sheer size But this is at least not obviously correct A possible modified coherence criterion could state that what is correlated with higher coherence is not the number of inferential connections but rather the inferential density of the system where the latter is obtained by dividing the number of inferential connections by the number of beliefs in the system We will return in section to the problem of defining the traditional concept of coherence while addressing some of the concerns that we have raised e g concerning the relationship between coherence and system size The point of departure for the present discussion however is the observation that several prominent self proclaimed coherentists construe the central concept and to some extent also its role in philosophical inquiry in ways that depart somewhat from the traditional view Among them we find Nicolas Rescher Keith Lehrer and Paul Thagard Central in Rescher s account as laid out in Rescher his most influential book on the subject is the notion of a truth candidate A proposition is a truth candidate if there is something that speaks in its favor Rescher s truth candidates are related to Lewis s supposed facts asserted In both cases the propositions of interest are prima facie rather than bona fide truths Although Rescher s book is entitled A Coherence Theory of Truth the purpose of Rescher s investigation is not to investigate the possibility of defining truth in terms of coherence but to find a truth criterion which he understands to be a systematic procedure for selecting from a set of conflicting and even contradictory truth candidates those elements which it is rational to accept as bona fide truths His solution amounts to first identifying the maximal consistent subsets of the original set i e the subsets that are consistent but would become inconsistent if extended by further elements of the original set and then choosing the most plausible among these subsets Plausibility is characterized in way that reveals no obvious relation to the traditional concept of coherence While the traditional concept of coherence plays a role in the philosophical underpinning of Rescher s theory it does not figure essentially in the final product In a later book Rescher develops a more traditional system theoretic view on coherence Rescher Keith Lehrer employs the concept of coherence in his definition of justification which in turn is a chief ingredient in his complex definition of knowledge According to Lehrer a person is justified in accepting a proposition just in case that proposition coheres with the relevant part of her cognitive system This is the relational concept of coherence alluded to earlier In Lehrer the relevant part is the acceptance system of the person consisting of propositions to the effect that the subject accepts this and that Thus S accepts that A would initially be in S s acceptance system but not A itself In later works Lehrer has emphasized the importance of coherence with a more complex cognitive entity which he calls the evaluation system e g Lehrer and The starting point of Lehrer s account of coherence is the fact that we can think of all sorts of objections an imaginative critic may raise to what a person accepts These objections might be directly incompatible with what that person accepts or they might threaten to undermine her reliability in making assessments of the kind in question For instance a critic might object to her claim that she sees a tree by suggesting that she is merely hallucinating That would be an example of the first sort of objection An example of the second sort would be a case in which the critic replies that the person cannot tell whether she is hallucinating or not Coherence and personal justification results when all objections have been met Lehrer s concept of coherence does not seem to have much in common with the traditional concept of mutual support If one takes it as essential that such a theory make use of a concept of systematic or global coherence then Lehrer s theory is not a coherence theory in the traditional sense because in Lehrer s view c oherence is not a global feature of the system nor does it depend on global features of the system Olsson has objected to this view by pointing out that it is difficult to understand what it means for a belief to fit into a system unless the former does so in virtue of adding to the global coherence of the latter Paul Thagard s theory is clearly influenced by the traditional concept of coherence but the specific way in which the theory is developed gives it a somewhat non traditional flavor in particular considering its strong emphasis on explanatory relations between beliefs Like Rescher Thagard takes the fundamental problem to be which elements of a given set of typically conflicting claims that have the status of prima facie truths to single out as acceptable However where Rescher proposes to base the choice of acceptable truths on considerations of plausibility Thagard suggests the use of explanatory coherence for that purpose According to Thagard prima facie truths can cohere fit together or incohere resist fitting together The first type of relation includes relations of explanation and deduction whereas the second type includes various types of incompatibility such as logical inconsistency If two propositions cohere this gives rise to a positive constraint If they incohere the result is a negative constraint A positive constraint between two propositions can be satisfied either by accepting both or by rejecting both By contrast satisfying a negative constraint means accepting one proposition while rejecting the other A coherence problem as Thagard sees it is one of dividing the initial set of propositions into those that are accepted and those that are rejected in such a way that most constraints are satisfied Thagard presents several different computational models for solving coherence problems including a model based on neural networks How acceptability depends on coherence more precisely is codified in Thagard s principles of explanatory coherence Thagard Principle E Data Priority reveals that Thagard s theory is not a pure coherence theory as it gives some epistemic priority to observational beliefs making it rather a form of weak foundationalism i e the view that some propositions have some initial epistemic support apart from coherence Moreover Thagard s theory is based on binary coherence incoherence relations i e relations holding between two propositions His basic theory does not handle incompatibilities that involve in an essential way more than two propositions But incompatibilities of that sort may very well arise as exemplified by the three propositions Jane is taller than Martha Martha is taller than Karen and Karen is taller than Jane Nevertheless Thagard reports the existence of computational methods for converting constraint satisfaction problems whose constraints involve more than two elements into problems that involve only binary constraints concluding that his characterization of coherence suffices in principle for dealing with more complex coherence problems with nonbinary constraints Thagard Thagard argues that there is a connection between explanatory coherence and approximate truth where explaining consists in describing causal mechanisms Several other authors have advocated coherence theories that emphasize the importance of explanatory relations See for example Lycan and for a book length defense of explanatory coherentism Poston Also related to Thagard s work is Susan Haack s so called foundherentist theory which draws on a proposed analogy between coherence justification with foundationalist ingredients and crossword puzzle solving Haack The arguably most significant development of the coherence theory in recent years has been the revival of C I Lewis s work and the research program he inspired by translating parts of the coherence theory into the language of probability The kind of coherence in question should be distinguished from a probability function being coherent in the sense of conforming to the axioms of the probability calculus The theory of coherence that we are concerned with here is an application of such coherent probability functions to model coherence as mutual support agreement etc Thus probabilistic coherence means something else than it does in standard Bayesian theories The probabilistic translations of coherence theory has made it possible to define concepts and prove results with mathematical precision It has also led to increased transferability of concepts and results across fields e g between coherence theory and confirmation theory as it is studied in philosophy of science As a result the study of coherence has developed into an interdisciplinary research program with connections to philosophy of science cognitive psychology artificial intelligence and philosophy of law We will encounter a spectacular example of such theoretical cross fertilization in a moment The rest of this entry will be devoted to this recent transformation of the subject To introduce Lewis s view on the role of coherence consider the following famous passage on relatively unreliable witnesses who independently tell the same story from his book While Lewis allows that individual reports need not be very credible considered in isolation for coherence to have a positive effect he is firmly committed to the view that their credibility must not be nil He writes in his discussion of reports from memory that i f there were no initial presumption attaching to the mnemically presented then no extent of congruity with other such items would give rise to any eventual credibility In other words if the beliefs in a set have no initial credibility then no justification will ensue from observing the coherence of that set Thus Lewis is advocating weak foundationalism rather than a pure coherence theory In apparent agreement with Lewis Laurence BonJour writes a s long as we are confident that the reports of the various witnesses are genuinely independent of each other a high enough degree of coherence among them will eventually dictate the hypothesis of truth telling as the only available explanation of their agreement However BonJour proceeds to reject Lewis s point about the need for positive antecedent credibility w hat Lewis does not see however is that his own witness example shows quite convincingly that no antecedent degree of warrant or credibility is required BonJour is here apparently denouncing Lewis s claim that coherence will not have any confidence boosting power unless the sources are initially somewhat credible BonJour is proposing that coherence can play this role even if there is no antecedent degree of warrant so long as the witnesses are delivering their reports independently Several authors have objected to this claim of BonJour s arguing that coherence does not have any effect on the probability of the report contents if the independent reports lack individual credibility The first argument to that effect was given by Michael Huemer A more general proof in the same vein is presented in Olsson What follows is a sketch of the latter argument for the special case of two testimonies couched essentially in the terminology of Huemer In the following all probabilities are assumed to lie strictly between and Let E be the proposition that the first witness reports that A and let E be the proposition that the second witness reports that A Consider the following conditions Conditional Independence P E mid E A P E mid A P E mid E neg A P E mid neg A Nonfoundationalism P A mid E P A P A mid E P A Coherence Justification P A mid E E gt P A Conditional independence is intended to capture the idea that the testimonies are independent in the sense that there is no direct influence between the testimonies The probability of a testimony is influenced only by the fact it reports on meaning that once that fact is given this screens off any probabilistic influence between the individual testimonies making them irrelevant to each other Nonfoundationalism states that neither testimony confers any justification upon A by itself assuming merely that one single witness has testified that A has no effect on the probability of A Finally Coherence Justification states that testimonies when combined do provide justification for A The debate between Lewis and BonJour can be reconstructed as a debate over the joint consistency of these three conditions BonJour is claiming that the conditions are jointly consistent and that Coherence Justification follows from Conditional Independence even in the context of Nonfoundationalism whereas Lewis is rejecting these claims Olsson established that if the dispute is couched in these terms then Lewis was provably right From Conditional Independence and Nonfoundationalism it follows via Bayes s theorem that so that combining collectively independent but individually useless testimonies however coherent fails to give rise to anything useful As noted in Olsson section the matter is somewhat complicated by the fact that Lewis adopted a notion of independence that is weaker than Conditional Independence Ironically Lewis s weaker notion turns out to be compatible with the combination of Nonfoundationalism and Coherence Justification This result might not apply to coherence theories in general Poston argues that BonJour s view being provably false in probability theory is an artefact of the probabilistic framework not shared by Thagard s theory of explanatory coherence Nonfoundationalism should be contrasted with the following condition Weak Foundationalism P A mid E gt P A P A mid E gt P A Weak Foundationalism which states that each testimony confirms at least some justification upon A by itself does not entail Coherence Justification it is common knowledge in probability theory that even if two pieces of evidence each support a given conclusion that support may disappear or even turn into disconfirmation if they are combined However in the context of Conditional Independence Weak Foundationalism does imply Coherence Justification Indeed the combined testimonies will in this case confer more support upon the conclusion than the testimonies did individually As confirmed by James Van Cleve the conclusions supported by these considerations are that coherence can boost justification or credibility that is already there without being able to create such justification or credibility from scratch There are various ways to save the coherence theory from this probabilistic attack The most radical strategy would be to dismiss the probabilistic framework as altogether unsuitable for coherentism Independent reasons for this response can be found in Thagard s work e g Thagard and A less radical approach would be to refrain from any blanket dismissal of probability theory in this context but reject one of the premises of the troublesome proof This is the strategy recently taken by Huemer who now considers his probabilistic refutation of coherentism to be mistaken Huemer footnote While he thinks that Coherentist Justification correctly captures a minimal sense of coherentism he reports dissatisfaction with both Conditional Independence and Nonfoundationalism his term for the latter is Strong Nonfoundationalism Huemer now thinks independence in the intuitive sense is better captured by the condition P E mid E A gt P E mid E neg A Moreover he takes the condition P A mid E neg E P A or Weak Nonfoundationalism in his terminology to be a more suitable explication of nonfoundationalist intuitions than the condition P A mid E P A He goes on to show that they are jointly consistent with Coherentist Justification there are probability distributions satisfying all three conditions Thus the immediate threat to coherentism presented by the observed inconsistency of the three original conditions has been neutralized even though a critic might point out that the defense is incomplete since it has not been shown that Coherence Justification follows from the two new conditions Whatever merits Huemer s new conditions might have their standing in the literature is hardly comparable to that of the original conditions Conditional Independence for instance is an extremely powerful and intuitive concept which has been put to fruitful use in many areas in philosophy and computer science the most spectacular example being the theory of Bayesian networks Pearl Similarly the Nonfoundationalist condition is still the most widely used and many would say most natural way of stating in the language of probability theory that a testimony fails to support that which is testified Thus it would seem that coherentism is saved at the price of disconnecting it from the way in which probability theory is standardly applied Roche criticizes Nonfoundationalism from another perspective In his view a close reading of BonJour reveals that the latter requires only that the witness reports lack individual credibility in the sense that P A mid E i and not in the sense of P A mid E i P A which is the condition we called Nonfoundationalism Since the former does not entail the latter coherentists to the extent that they follow BonJour need not worry about the joint inconsistency of Conditional Independence Nonfoundationalism and Coherence Justification Still this account of what it means to lack initial credibility is non standard if taken as a general characterization and it may in the end be more charitable to interpret BonJour as not having subscribed to it For an elaboration of this point the reader is referred to Olsson footnote In later works BonJour has gradually distanced himself his original coherentist position e g BonJour and We recall that Lewis s defined coherence or congruence not for any old set of proposition but rather for a set of supposed facts asserted One way to capture this idea is in terms of the notion of a testimonial system introduced in Olsson A testimonial system S is a set langle E A rangle ldots langle E n A n rangle where E i is a report to the effect that A i is true We will say that A i is the content of report E i The content of a testimonial system S langle E A rangle ldots langle E n A n rangle is the ordered set of report contents langle A ldots A n rangle By the degree of coherence C S of such a testimonial system we will mean the degree of coherence of its content Bovens and Hartmann proposed a similar representation of supposed facts asserted in terms of ordered sets To illustrate these concepts consider a case in which all witnesses report exactly the same thing e g that John was at the crime scene That would be a paradigm case of a highly coherent set of reports Now contrast this situation with one in which only one witness reports this That would be a situation which would intuitively not qualify as coherent Indeed it does not even seem meaningful to apply the concept of coherence to a case of just one report except in the trivial sense in which everything coheres with itself Letting A be the proposition John was at the crime scene and E ldots E n the corresponding reports this intuitive difference can be represented as the difference between two testimonial systems S langle E A rangle ldots langle E n A rangle and S langle E A rangle If by contrast the entities to which coherence applies are represented as simple unstructured sets the sets of testimonies in question would be given the same formal representation in terms of the set having A as its sole member By a probabilistic coherence measure as defined for ordered sets of propositions we shall mean any numerical measure C A ldots A n defined solely in terms of the probability of A ldots A n and their Boolean combinations and standard arithmetical operations Olsson This definition makes the degree of coherence of a set of witness reports a function of the probability of the report contents and their Boolean combinations Huemer refers to this consequence as the Content Determination Thesis We will return to the status of this thesis in section in connection with the recent impossibility results for coherence A reasonable constraint on any coherence measure is that the degree of coherence of an ordered set should be independent of the particular way in which the content propositions are listed Thus C langle A A ldots A n rangle C langle B B ldots B n rangle whenever langle B B ldots B n rangle is a permutation of langle A A ldots A n rangle This is a formal way of stating that all propositions in the relevant set should be treated as epistemic equals All measures that will be discussed below satisfy this condition Our starting point will be an attempt to identify the degree of coherence of a set with its joint probability However it is easily seen that this is not a plausible proposal Consider the following two cases Case Two witnesses point out the same person as the perpetrator John say Case One witness states that John or James did it and the other witness that John or Mary did it Since the joint probability is the same in both cases equaling the probability that John did it they yield the same degree of coherence as measured by C And yet the reports in the first case are more coherent from a presystematic standpoint because the witnesses are in complete agreement One way of handling this example would be to define coherence as relative overlap in the following sense Glass Olsson C A B which also takes on values between and measures how much of the total probability mass assigned to either A or B falls into their intersection The degree of coherence is if and only if P A wedge B i e just in case A and B do not overlap at all and it is if and only if P A wedge B P A vee B i e just in case A and B coincide The measure is straightforwardly generalizable This measure assigns the same coherence value namely to all cases of total agreement regardless of the number of witnesses that are involved Against this it may be objected that agreement among the many is more coherent than agreement among the few an intuition that can be accounted for by the following alternative measure introduced by Shogenji or as Shogenji proposes to generalize it It is easy to see that this measure is sensitive in the way we suggested to the number of reports in cases of total agreement n agreeing reports correspond to a coherence value of bfrac P A n meaning that as n approaches infinity so does the degree of coherence Like the other measures C A B equals if and only if A and B do not overlap An alternative generalization of the Shogenji measure is presented in Shupbach However whatever its philosophical merits Schupbach s proposal is considerably more complex than Shogenji s original suggestion Akiba and Moretti and Akiba raise a number of worries for the Shogenji measure and for probabilistic measures of coherence generally but they seem to be predicated on the assumption that the concept of coherence is interestingly applicable to unordered sets of propositions an assumption that we found reason to question above C and C can also be contrasted with regard to their sensitivity to the specificity of the propositions involved Consider two cases The first case involves two witnesses both claiming that John committed the crime The second case involves two witnesses both making the weaker disjunctive claim that John Paul or Mary committed the crime Which pair of witnesses are delivering the more coherent set One way to reason is as follows Since both cases involve fully agreeing testimonies the degree of coherence should be the same This is also the result we get if we apply C But one could maintain instead that since the first two witnesses agree on something more specific a particular individual s guilt the degree of coherence should be higher This is what we get if we apply C In an attempt at reconciliation Olsson suggested that C and C may capture two different concepts of coherence While C measures the degree of agreement of a set C is more plausible as a measure of how striking the agreement is See Olsson for an extended discussion of this point Recently however Koscholke and Schippers have noted a counterintuitive feature of C that it is impossible to increase a set s degree of coherence by adding further propositions to the set They also show that according to a more sophisticated relative overlap measure which avoids this issue no set s degree of coherence exceeds the degree of coherence of its maximally coherent subset On the other hand they also prove in a later article in collaboration with Stegman that there is a further relative overlap measure which avoids both these problems and which therefore in their view re establishes relative overlap as a candidate for a proper formalization of coherence Koscholke Schippers and Stegman A further much discussed measure is that proposed in Fitelson It is based on the intuition that the degree of coherence of a set E should be a quantitative probabilistic generalization of the deductive logical coherence of E ibid Fitelson takes it to be a consequence of this idea that a maximum constant degree of coherence is attained if the propositions in E are all logically equivalent and consistent This is in accordance with C but not with C which as we saw is sensitive to the specificity prior probability of the propositions involved Fitelson who approached the subject from the standpoint of confirmation theory proposed a complex coherence measure based on Kemeny and Oppenheim s measure of factual support A further innovative idea is that Fitelson extends this measure to take into account support relations holding between all subsets in the set E whereas Lewis we recall only considered the support relation holding between one element and the rest The degree of coherence of a set finally is defined as the mean support among the subsets of E An alleged counterexample to this measure can be found in Siebel and criticisms and proposed amendments in Meijs An extended critique of subset measures i e measures that require extensive computation of support relations between subsets can be found in Olsson Olsson s criticism focuses on problems of epistemic access computational complexity probability assessment and excessive support The reader may wish to consult Bovens and Hartmann Douven and Meijs Roche a Shippers a Koscholke and Hartmann and Trpin forthcoming for further coherence measures and how they fare in relation to test cases in the literature and Koscholke and Jekel for an empirical study of coherence assessments drawing on similar examples The latter study indicates that the measures by Douven and Meijs and by Roche are more in line with intuitive judgement than other established measures Olsson s treatise is an updated defense of the Glass Olsson measure C not as a conceptual analysis but as an explication in the sense of Carnap Finally some authors have applied coherence measures to inconsistent sets e g Schippers b and Schippers and Siebel It is fair to say that coherence theorists have yet to reach anything like consensus on how best to define coherence in probabilistic terms Nevertheless the debate so far has given rise to a much more fine grained understanding of what the options are and what consequences they have The probably most notable result of this debate outside philosophy is the application of probabilistic coherence measures to topic coherence in AI where a topic is viewed as a set of keywords giving the gist of a text e g a blog entry or a newspaper article Newman et al are credited for the idea of the coherence of a topic being a significant factor aiding understanding However their article does not refer to the philosophical literature on coherence measures Ideally evaluating the coherence of a topic should be automatic R der et al suggested using known probabilistic coherence measures for this purpose taking as their point of departure the measures proposed by Bovens and Hartmann Douven and Meijs Fitelson Olsson and Shogenji R der et al proceed to define the concept of a coherence measures abstractly and they show that a new measure they construct performs better in terms of giving rise to a stronger correlation with user assessments of topic coherence than the above known measures Returning to philosophy some quite surprising conclusions can be drawn for epistemological purposes even without philosophers agreeing on how to measure coherence all we need to assume in order to prove that no coherence measure can be truth conducive in a sense to be explained is that those measures respect the aforementioned Content Determination Thesis Peter Klein and Ted Warfield s paper in Analysis initiated a lively and instructive debate on the relationship between coherence and probability e g Klein and Warfield and Merricks Shogenji Cross Akiba Olsson Fitelson and Siebel According to Klein and Warfield just because one set of beliefs is more coherent than another set this does not mean that the first set is more likely to be true On the contrary a higher degree of coherence can so they claimed be associated with a lower probability of the whole set The idea behind their reasoning is simple We can often raise the coherence of an informational set by adding more information that explains the information already in the set But as more genuinely new information is added the probability that all the elements of the set are true is correspondingly diminished This Klein and Warfield wrote follows from the well known inverse relationship between probability and informational content They concluded that coherence is not truth conducive Much in the spirit of C I Lewis Klein and Warfield illustrated their argument referring to a detective story the so called Dunnit example It turns out that this example is unnecessarily complex and that the main point can be illustrated by reference to a simpler case borrowed from computer science where it is used to exemplify the concept of non monotonic inference Suppose that you are told by one source Jane that Tweety is a bird and by another source Carl that Tweety cannot fly The resulting information set S langle Tweety is a bird Tweety cannot fly rangle is not particularly coherent from an intuitive standpoint Nor is it coherent from the point of view of Lewis s definition assuming one of the items true decreases the probability of the other At this point it would be reasonable to conjecture that either Jane or Carl is not telling the truth However upon consulting a further source Rick we receive the information that Tweety is a penguin The new set S langle Tweety is a bird Tweety cannot fly Tweety is a penguin rangle is surely more coherent than S In explaining the previous anomaly the information supplied by Rick contributes to the explanatory coherence of the set The new enlarged set S is more coherent than the original smaller set S And yet S being less informative is more probable than S the conjunction of all the propositions in S is more probable than the conjunction of all the propositions in S Hence more coherence does not necessarily imply higher likelihood of truth in the sense of higher joint probability Klein and Warfield seem to be right coherence is not truth conducive But as will soon be clear this conclusion is premature As a preliminary let us state Klein and Warfield s argument more formally using the following abbreviations The first information set S consists of A and A The second more coherent set S contains in addition A We let C denote the degree of coherence intuitively understood What we have then is As we saw due to the greater informational content of the larger set its probability is lower than that of the smaller set Yet behind this seemingly impeccable piece of reasoning lurks a serious difficulty As we saw it is part of the example that we are supposed to know also that Jane reports that Tweety is a bird that Carl reports that Tweety cannot fly and that Rick reports that Tweety is a penguin Klein and Warfield s example is similar in this way Let The well known principle of total evidence now dictates that all relevant evidence should be taken into consideration when computing probabilities Since it cannot be excluded at the outset that the evidence represented by E E may be relevant to the probability of the information sets S and S the probability of the smaller set is not P A A but rather P A A mid E E Similarly the probability of the larger set is not P A A A but rather P A A A mid E E E Bovens and Olsson raised the question whether given this revised understanding of the probability of a set of reported propositions it would still follow that extended sets are no more probable than the sets they extend Referring to our Tweety example would it still hold that Bovens and Olsson demonstrated that the answer to the general question is in the negative by giving an example of a more coherent extended set that is also more probable on the revised understanding of what this means than the original smaller set Klein and Warfield s reasoning is based on a problematic understanding of the joint probability of a set of reported propositions In the end they have not shown that coherence is not truth conducive Let us say that a measure C of coherence is propositionally truth conducive if and only if the following holds if C A ldots A n gt C B ldots B m then P A wedge ldots wedge A n gt P B wedge ldots wedge B m One lesson emerging from the Analysis debate is that this way of construing truth conduciveness should be replaced by a notion of truth conduciveness where the relevant probabilities take all relevant evidence into account whatever that evidence may be beliefs testimonies etc For example a coherence measure C is doxastically truth conducive for a subject S if and only if if C A ldots A n gt C B ldots B m then P A wedge ldots wedge A n mid mathrm Bel S A ldots mathrm Bel S A n gt P B wedge ldots wedge B m mid mathrm Bel S B ldots mathrm Bel S B m where mathrm Bel S A abbreviates S believes that A In other words a measure of coherence is doxastically truth conducive just in case a more coherent set of believed propositions is jointly more probable than a less coherent set of believed propositions While this suggestion has not been without its critics e g McGrew it has been highly influential In the following we will adopt this understanding of truth conduciveness The impossibility results for coherence draw on all three debates summarized above the Lewis BonJour controversy the debate over probabilistic measures of coherence and also the dispute in Analysis regarding truth conduciveness Before we can discuss the results we need to make one further observation Given the conclusion of the Lewis BonJour dispute it is a reasonable expectation that no coherence measure is truth conducive in the relevant conditional sense unless the reports beliefs memories etc in question are individually credible and collectively independent See Olsson for a discussion of the plausibility of these conditions in the original Lewisian context of the justification of memory But assuming this is not sufficient for coherence to stand a reasonable chance of being truth conducive We must also require that when we compare two different sets of reports we do so while keeping the degree of individual credibility fixed Otherwise we could have a situation in which one set of report contents is more coherent than another set but still fails to give rise to a higher likelihood of truth simply because the reporters delivering the propositions in the less coherent set are individually more reliable Thus truth conduciveness must be understood in a ceteris paribus sense The question of interest then is whether more coherence implies a higher probability given independence and individual credibility everything else being equal We are now finally in a position to state the impossibility theorems What they show is that no measure of coherence is truth conducive even in a weak ceteris paribus sense under the favorable conditions of conditional independence and individual credibility The first result of this nature was presented by Bovens and Hartmann Their definition of truth conduciveness deviates slightly from the standard account given above As they define it a measure C is truth conducive if and only if for all sets S and S if S is at least as coherent as S according to C then S is at least as likely to be true as S ceteris paribus and given independence and individual credibility Very roughly their proof has the following structure They show that there are sets S and S each containing three propositions such that which set is more likely to be true will depend on the level at which the individual credibility reliability is held fixed Thus for lower degrees of reliability one set say S will be more probable than the other set S for higher degrees of reliability the situation will be reversed One can now find a counterexample to the truth conduciveness of any measure C through a strategic choice of the level at which the reliability is held fixed Suppose for instance that according to C the set S is more coherent than the set S In order to construct a counterexample to C s truth conduciveness we set the reliability to a value for which S will be more probable than S If on the other hand C makes S more coherent than S we fix the reliability to a level at which S will be the more probable set For the details see Bovens and Hartmann section Olsson defines truth conduciveness in the standard fashion His impossibility theorem is based on the following alternative proof strategy Olsson appendix B Consider a situation of two witnesses both reporting that A represented by S langle A A rangle Take a measure C of coherence that is informative with respect to S in the sense that it does not assign the same degree of coherence to S regardless of which probability assignment is used This means that the measure is non trivial in the situation in question Take two assignments P and P of probabilities to the propositions in S that give rise to different coherence values Olsson shows that a counter example to the truth conduciveness of C can be constructed through a strategic choice of the probability of reliability If P makes S more coherent than does P according to C we fix the probability of reliability in such a way that S comes out as more probable on P than on P If on the other hand P makes S more coherent then we choose a value for the probability of reliability so that P makes S more probable It follows that no coherence measure is both truth conducive and informative There are some further subtle differences between the two results First Olsson s theorem is proved against the backdrop of a dynamic or in the language of Bovens and Hartmann endogenous model of reliability the assessment of witness reliability which in this model is represented as a probability of reliability may change as we obtain more reports Bovens and Hartmann s detailed proof assumes a non dynamic exogenous model of reliability although they indicate that the result carries over to the dynamic endogenous case Second there is a difference in the way the ceteris paribus condition is understood Olsson fixes the initial probability of reliability but allows the prior probability of the report contents to vary Bovens and Hartmann fix not only the reliability but also the prior probability of the report contents These impossibility results give rise to a thought provoking paradox It can hardly be doubted that we trust and rely on coherence reasoning when judging the believability of information in everyday life and in science see Harris and Hahn for an experimental study in a Bayesian setting But how can this be when in fact coherence is not truth conducive Since the impossibility results were published a number of studies have been dedicated to the resolution of this paradox see Meijs and Douven for an overview of some possible moves These studies can be divided into two camps Researchers in the first camp accept the conclusion that the impossibility results show that coherence is not truth conducive They add however that this does not prevent coherence from being valuable and important in other ways Researchers in the other camp do not accept the conclusion that the impossibility results show that coherence is not truth conducive because they think that at least one premise used in proving the results is doubtful Let us start with responses from the first camp Dietrich and Moretti show that coherence in the sense of the Glass Olsson measure is linked to the practice of indirect confirmation of scientific hypotheses That measure turns out to be in the terminology of Moretti confirmation conducive Glass argues similarly that coherence can provide the key to a precise account of inference to the best explanation the main idea being to use a coherence measure for ranking competing hypotheses in terms of their coherence with a given piece of evidence Furthermore Olsson and Schubert observe that while coherence falls short of being truth conducive it can still be reliability conducive i e more coherence according to some measures entails a higher probability that the sources are reliable at least in a paradigmatic case cf Schubert a Nevertheless Schubert has proved an impossibility theorem to the effect that no coherence measure is reliability conducive in general Schubert b For yet another example Angere argues based on computer simulations that the fact that coherence fails to be truth conducive in the above sense does not prevent it from being connected with truth in a weaker defeasible sense In fact almost all coherence measures that have an independent standing in the literature satisfy the condition that most cases of higher coherence are also cases of higher probability although they do so to different degrees Moreover Roche b has demonstrated that assuming a set to be coherent implies an increase in the probability of truth of any of its elements This is a weak form of truth conduciveness as this increase may be modest and Roche is right to point out that it should not give the coherentist much comfort It has also been noted that coherence plays an important negative role in our thinking If our beliefs show signs of incoherence this is often a good reason for contemplating a revision See chapter in Olsson for an elaboration of this point and McGrew for some complications in the context of witness testimony As for the other approach to the impossibility results questioning the premises used in their derivation we have already seen that Huemer in connection with the Lewis BonJour dispute has expressed doubts regarding the standard way of formalizing independence in terms of conditional probability It should come as no surprise that he objects to the impossibility results ibid on the same grounds In his article Huemer even questions the Content Determination Thesis which plays a pivotal role in the derivation of the results for reasons that we have to leave aside here All these things can be consistently questioned But the question is at what cost We have already seen that there are strong systematic reasons for explicating independence in terms of conditional independence in the standard way Furthermore the Content Determination Thesis is deeply entrenched in just about all work on coherence that takes agreeing witnesses to be the prototypical case Giving up Content Determination would mean purging the coherence theory of one of its clearest and most distinctive pre systematic intuitions that coherence is a property at the level of report contents The worry is that coherentism is saved at the cost of robbing it of almost all its significance as Ewing put it almost a century ago in response to a similar worry Ewing These concerns do not obviously carry over to another dialectical move questioning the ceteris paribus conditions employed in the impossibility results i e the conditions that determine what to hold fixed as the degree of coherence is varied This line of criticism has been taken up by several authors including Douven and Meijs Schupbach and Huemer and it may well be the internally least problematic strategy to explore for those who are inclined to challenge the premises upon which the impossibility results are based It should be borne in mind though that the tendency to offer ever stronger ceteris paribus conditions may in the end be self defeating As more things are held fixed it becomes easier for a coherence measure to be truth conducive Hence researchers pursuing this line of defense ultimately run the risk of trivializing the debate by making coherence truth conducive by definition cf Schubert b There are some attempts to explain or come to grips with the impossibility results that do not easily fit into the two camps identified above or represent a combination of ideas from both For an example of the latter Wheeler see also Wheeler and Scheines both suggest focusing on reliability conduciveness as opposed to truth conduciveness camp and question the assumptions primarily independence but also the Content Determination Thesis used in the derivation of the impossibility results camp Shogenji and McGraw are other complex and insightful attempts to deepen the Bayesian analysis and diagnose of those results Specifically Lydia McGrew argues for a shift in focus from the coherence of contents of reports to coherence of the evidence for a hypothesis H which need not coincide with the conjunction of the report contents If the conjunction of the members of a set of evidence supports in the sense of raising the probability of some hypothesis H and if all members of that set are playing a role in that epistemic effect then that set of evidence is McGrew shows indeed confirmatory of H and in that sense truth conducive for H McGrew McGrew offers several proposals for how to spell out coherence for H The coherence theory of justification represents an initially suggestive solution to some deeply rooted problems of epistemology Perhaps most significantly it suggests a way of thinking about epistemic justification as arising in a web of belief As such it competes with and could potentially replace the historically dominating but increasingly disreputable foundationalist picture of the justification needed for knowledge as resting on a secure base of indubitable fact Coherentism may also be more promising than alternative foundationalist views with their reliance on non doxastic support Unfortunately coherence theorists have generally struggled to provide the details necessary for their theory to advance beyond the metaphorical stage something which has not gone unnoticed by their critics Following the seminal work of C I Lewis contemporary scholars have taken on that challenge with considerable success in terms of clarity and established results although a fair number of the latter are to the coherentist s disadvantage Some results support a weak foundationalist theory according to which coherence can boost credibility that is already there without creating it from scratch However on the face of it the impossibility results negatively affect this less radical form of coherence theory as well It is often observed that while it is relatively easy to put forward a convincing theory in the outline the ultimate test for any philosophical endeavor is whether the product will survive detailed specification the devil is in the details and so on What the recent developments in this area have shown if nothing else is that this is very much true for the coherence theory of epistemic justification epistemology justification epistemic foundationalist theories of

As you drive through the mountain roads toward the small town of Liye in Longshan county Hunan province in late autumn you are greeted by countless orange trees laden with fruit The oranges are nearly or fully ripe and paint the valley in shades of gold A well known local specialty oranges from Liye are distributed nationwide and the residents take great pride in their produce probably much like their ancestors did more than years ago During the Qin Dynasty BC this area then known as Qianling county was abundant with orange groves as recorded on bamboo and wooden slips that served as government documents at the time Farmers granaries were filled with millet and other grains while locally grown wax gourds were presented to Qin emperors as tributes Last week the Liye Qin Slips Museum and the Liye Ancient Town Archaeological Site Park reopened to the public following a comprehensive renovation Opened in the museum is the first in China dedicated to the preservation display and research of the invaluable Qin slips It was built facing the archaeological site where nearly slips were discovered in unearthed from an ancient Qin Dynasty well These slips containing more than characters offer remarkable insights into the Qin government s political system and everyday life in this border town The text on the slips provides detailed information about the local population products taxation judicial system postal services and medicine making them one of the most significant archaeological discoveries related to the Qin Dynasty During a ceremony to mark the reopening of the museum more than slips which had been preserved and studied by other institutions were returned and added to its collection The renovated museum s main exhibitions guide visitors through various aspects of life in the ancient Qianling county One of the most popular exhibits features a slip inscribed with a multiplication table evidence that Chinese people used this calculation method more than years ago predating its use in the West Rats those perennial pests that plagued granaries and spread disease were also a constant thorn in the side of the Qin people Records of rat catching by local officials and granary clerks are seen on several slips displayed in the museum In addition to the Qin slips the exhibition features other artifacts including bronze wares and ceramics most of which were also unearthed at the Liye site The museum also features digital interactive zones that incorporate VR AR and AI technologies offering visitors an immersive trip through history Among the experts attending the reopening ceremony of the museum was Long Jingsha one of the archaeologists who led the excavation of the slips in Reflecting on his work years ago Long recalls how he and his colleagues had to dig through the mud bare handed to retrieve the slips from the meter deep ancient well We considered wearing gloves to protect our hands from the stone and ceramic debris mixed in the mud he says But only with bare hands could we sensibly feel the fragile slips and hold them carefully Today archaeological work continues at the Liye site and surrounding areas Long says aiming to connect separate ancient towns and tombs and gather more materials for research into the commandery county governance system of the Qin Dynasty Zhang Chunlong a researcher at the Hunan Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology notes that of the nearly slips unearthed in Liye about contain written characters To date more than have been analyzed with photos and text explanations published in three volumes of Liye Qinjian Liye Qin Slips Zhang says adding that he and his colleagues are working on Volume IV which will include the texts from more than slips limuyun chinadaily com cn

When international audiences encounter the bronze masks of Sanxingdui they re not just viewing ancient artifacts they re expanding their conception of what human societies can achieve and how diverse the pathways to prosperity and cultural flourishing can be Hopefully some European politicians and media can stop playing the role of anxiety mongers and abandon their narrow minded perspectives This mentality is detrimental to the long term development of Europe s new energy industry and will ultimately hinder Europe s opportunities for new energy development China has always demonstrated its sense of responsibility through real deeds and will continue to uphold the concept of building a community with a shared future for humanity as it works with other countries to advance global climate governance Listening to rational voices at home and seizing opportunities for pragmatic cooperation is the wise choice for Ottawa Through pragmatic innovation and international cooperation China is accelerating long term global sustainable development and presenting a path of green shared and cooperative development to the world The wording used by the Chinese Embassy in Israel this time is stern not only as a condemnation of Toporovsky s personal conduct but also as a warning to others who should see reality clearly pull back from the edge immediately and cease all provocations and opportunism Many hands will shape the Arctic s future and China s early contributions guided by principles of mutual respect and sustainable development set an encouraging precedent Why do US media repeatedly play out this script It serves as a political deflection Mere lip service to anti war slogans without a sober understanding of the war s root causes and historical lessons amounts to superficial emotional expression Currently China UK relations are slowly emerging from their low point and gradually improving But what is the key to fostering a healthy and stable relationship History has shown that becoming a frontline base in great power competition does not guarantee security instead it exposes a country to the risk of being drawn into conflicts While hyping the so called role of third countries US politicians have dodged their responsibility that the US and its allies bear for the prolonged conflict in Ukraine Cold war mentalities and one size fits all development formulas no longer define the world Real progress now depends on pluralism adaptation and searching for context appropriate solutions even if those solutions like the Fengqiao Experience come from outside the Western tradition For the Philippines which is seeking to rapidly strengthen its maritime military capability Japan s retired Abukuma class destroyer escorts are being imbued with new imagination However the so called talisman that the Philippines believes it possesses is for the region nothing more than a hot potato an even greater source of anxiety External noises cannot change the PICs independent judgment of who their genuine development partners are nor can they erase the sound model of cooperation between China and those countries Ultimately it is the win win outcomes of cooperation that speak the most convincing language Whether the UK government can demonstrate sincerity through consistency of words and deeds and truly exercise strategic autonomy will be the key factor determining how far this dialogue can go China s countermeasures against Seki are a warning to radical anti China elements They demonstrate China s determination to safeguard its core interests while drawing a clear red line for bilateral relations For provocateurs punishment is inevitable for friends and partners China s door will always remain open Clearly by pushing the China threat in space narrative in such high profile manners the US essentially aims to legitimize its own expansion of space armaments and to secure more budgets However the logic of arms races ultimately leads to self inflicted decline Once hailed as the bedrock of global finance the US dollar now teeters on the precipice of a crisis of trust The era of dollar exceptionalism where the currency stood invincible is rapidly crumbling under the weight of Washington s own missteps which have continuously pushed the world to look for alternatives Today China commemorates V Day with a military parade to demonstrate its unwavering commitment to its original aspirations and to Chinese modernization At its core is peaceful development Only with reliable capabilities can nations defend peace prevent war and create space for growth and exchange The warming of China India relations is not a side effect of the US tariff war but a proactive choice for the future made by both nations Broad opportunities for multilateral cooperation form the real logic of the relationship While the reported move of the US president not attending the Quad summit exposes the loose commitment of the US toward its allies and partners it also reflects the dilemma of US led small circles characterized by confrontation isolation and exclusivity Systematic exchanges and engagement targeting Japanese youth should be continuously promoted to help them break through cognitive limitations and rebuild an autonomous and critical awareness of historical responsibility Today s China differs vastly from the nation of eight decades ago as does today s US Both countries have undergone tremendous transformations What remains unchanged is the longing of both peoples for peace and better lives This shared aspiration should form the foundation for bilateral development Banning a film cannot silence the countless descendants of China in their pursuit of collective memory altering a page of history cannot obscure the epic of the nation written in blood and fire by compatriots on both sides The Green Camp s desperate struggles are nothing more than ants trying to shake a tree a humiliation they bring upon themselves Europe s major economies resemble fragile building blocks teetering on the brink of instability It isn t simply grappling with economic problems it s caught up in a larger strategic misstep following the wrong lead and down the wrong path The question remains will Europe awaken this time A country that cannot reconcile with its past will never truly win the trust of others If Japan cannot squarely face and reflect on its history of aggression with an honest attitude it will never earn the trust of its Asian neighbors and the international community The vast wealth gap is a product of the US political and economic develop ment model which in turn influences the evolution of these systems constraining the US soft power and influence on the international stage A country that cannot properly address homelessness on its streets is hardly in a position to tell others how to run their countries as some US politicians often do Markets never erect barriers against inconsequential competitors Nvidia s difficulties entering the Chinese market precisely confirm the rise of China s semiconductor industry In recent years the EU has adopted what might be called a perfunctory response model to crises The message of the trilateral dialogue is simple but profound Despite complexity cooperation remains the most realistic and the most rational choice From economic leaps to educational progress from ecological protection to ethnic unity the snowy plateau has delivered a substantial and impressive development report The cultural dignity of the Chinese people is not to be provoked and the prosperity of the consumer market must be built on mutual respect Looking deeper the reason some people in US political circles insist on dragging China into the US Russia narrative lies in the inertia of Cold War thinking At the same time the boundary question is a historical complex and long term issue Positive momentum is hard won and must be carefully sustained This calls for combining political guidance with institutionalized management maintaining a long term strategic view broadening shared interests to deepen mutual trust strengthening public support through practical cooperation and advancing solutions through effective management of differences As the world s two largest developing countries the urgent task is to advance each country s development rather than fall into a zero sum geopolitical contest Recently Manila has repeatedly sought to stir up tensions at sea pushing for the securitization of the South China Sea narrative in the international public arena in an attempt to turn the issue into a global hotspot and thereby highlight its so called strategic value US pressure on African countries to take sides only strengthens Africa s resolve for independent development As the spirit Vautrin embodied is demonstrated in Dead to Rights this movie resonates across languages and cultures because it highlights the most fundamental forms of goodness and courage Lies are like sandcastles on the beach they may appear sturdy but they can t withstand the waves of reality The most ludicrous part is that the so called conflict has not yet occured but Marcos theatrical performance is already in full swing Ultimately whose version of openness better reflects the spirit of our time Whose path injects more genuine innovation into the global AI landscape China India relations are at a critical juncture gradually emerging from a low point It makes far more sense to utilize each other s strengths work on practical cooperation and promote mutual benefit win win outcomes and shared development Is India s mistake really buying Russian oil or simply not following US orders Behind this tariff battle lies a harsh reminder India can be a great friend but only on the condition that it stays obedient The moment India fails to meet US strategic expectations it instantly becomes expendable The Chinese military will continue to forge ahead not only to safeguard China itself but also contribute more strength for stability peace and cooperation in the region and beyond For Chinese manufacturing to maintain global competitiveness it must accelerate structural upgrading strengthen technological innovation enhance service capabilities and develop international brands To remain competitive globally Europe should have the courage to make independent fact based judgments instead of dancing to the tune of US security risk scare tactics Otherwise what Europe truly risks is sacrificing its own industrial competitiveness and future development opportunities on the altar of someone else s political agenda To stabilize China Japan relations Japan must show genuine sincerity through concrete actions instead of fluctuating between provocation and cooperation The Taiwan Straits are not a projection screen for Britain s imperial nostalgia a stage for some politicians to perform their political grandstanding nor an arena for countries to show off their geopolitical relevance Asian countries must collectively emerge from the shadow of colonialism and rely on Asian wisdom to address Asian problems free from external interference and misleading narratives The actual effect of the AI Action Plan is affected by a number of factors Only time will tell how the plan will roll out For a country that repeatedly walks away from even the most foundational UN cultural body to accuse others of power grabs is the height of contradiction The real issue is not whether China is stepping up to fill the vacuum but the US growing tendency to step back The US side described Philippine President Macros visit as beautiful However it appears the outcomes for Manila are not so beautiful delivering little in terms of substantive gains and leaving the Philippines disappointed Recently international discussions on reviving trilateral cooperation among China Russia and India have increased What is the significance of such cooperation Read what three Chinese experts have to say on this matter Australia has a good grasp of its relationship with China and doesn t need outsiders peddling anxiety Some Western politicians still believe that NATO s outdated playbook can work in the Asia Pacific even though the region has clearly moved on to a very different chapter Trying to fan the flames might stir up a little dust but disrupting the region s deep rooted aspirations for peace and prosperity That s a much harder task The Western narrative that China is exploiting the West s aid cuts to expand its influence in Southeast Asia is purely measuring others corn by one s own bushel a projection of zero sum thinking The fabrication of blue background white text reports must be met with severe punishment For judicial bodies this novel form of rumor mongering designed to grab attention must be punished according to the law to set the record straight China Philippine cooperation in education once had a solid foundation but it is now being severely undermined primarily due to unilateral actions by the Philippine side In light of China s latest overseas study alert the Philippines needs to reflect on issues that go far beyond education The Japanese government s message to domestic firms operating in Taiwan region that they ll be on their own if a crisis breaks out sounds less like a contingency plan and more like a blunt dose of realism When real pressure hits there s far less the government can do than what its slogans might lead people to believe The so called humanitarian city risks further worsening an already dire humanitarian crisis and dashing hopes for a political solution to the Palestinian question The key to breaking the deadlock in Gaza lies in steadfastly upholding and implementing the two state solution The true path to peace lies in respecting the core concerns of all parties and seeking balance through equitable dialogue rather than fostering new conflicts through threats and sanctions Japan should seriously pursue regional coordination grounded in openness and cooperation The Philippines must ask itself a serious question Is it prepared to sacrifice its immediate economic interests and long term political gains And even if it does make such a sacrifice will this really deliver the outcome the Philippines is hoping for China s mid year economic performance is more than just a set of numbers it s a reaffirmation of the value of globalization itself If the EU wants to work with China to promote a green future then it should begin by removing its politicization lens and dismantling the unjust trade barriers against Chinese green products The organizers and participants of any performance need to respect and value the audience more and improve their viewing experience This is what it means to jointly maintain the norms and integrity of the cultural consumption market History has shown that tariff wars are reckless unpopular and unsustainable Although the US has attempted to project an image of being a better partner than China in ternational opinion remains skeptical about its prospects After all the deeply ingrained approach of wooing when needed abandoning when not and burning others to give themselves light makes it challenging for the US to genuinely earn Africa s trust From farmland to coffee chain the wild imagination fueling the Chinese threat narrative is clearly spinning out of control in the US Using national security as a catch all excuse is not making the US safer it is pushing it deeper into prejudice irrationality and isolation In essence Anthony Albanese s Australian way is an expression of strategic autonomy But why did his push for Australian independence trigger such a reaction It reflects the entrenched habit of dependency among some Australian politicians on the US to the extent that they seem to have lost the ability to assess Australia s own national interest said a Chinese expert This schizophrenic approach militarizing one pole while abandoning science at the other exposes a more profound truth The ice caps are vanishing the planet is burning but Washington s vision remains frozen in last century s rivalries Its focus remains on maintaining hegemonic power over the entire Earth The US is no longer a leader in free trade but one of the greatest disruptors of the current international system From mandating percent American made flags to claiming that foreign made boots threaten troop readiness these political farces have become some of the most biting ironies of the country s professed commitment to free trade Within the US Indo Pacific Strategy the Quad is viewed as a key mechanism for establishing a regional containment framework intended to limit China s peaceful development However for the other three Quad members Japan Australia and India the Quad functions more as a diplomatic tool to enhance their influence in regional affairs rather than being entirely subordinate to Washington s strategic agenda Pacific nations are not anyone s natural allies nor are they obligated to reciprocate simply because of financial input They have their own judgment and development priorities Cooperation is never a zero sum game Being seen does not mean others must disappear What the South Pacific needs is not a war of labels but more development This is not about who wins or loses but a test of humanity s respect for life dignity and hope China has forged a Chinese model in the fight against drugs that can be emulated This model is not only China s own way but also a part of the global drug control efforts As turbulence clouds the global landscape and many question the future of globalization the ever growing China Singapore relationship steadily charts a promising path forward The US attempt to sever the supply chain through administrative means is gradually being undermined by the dual forces of market dynamics and technological progress The fentanyl crisis claims tens of thousands of American lives annually a more direct and deadly threat than any external danger As one of the world s wealthiest nations the US struggle to protect its citizens from drug harm deserves weighty introspection What Australia needs is a more independent security strategy that does not rely on any major power and is based on its own geopolitical realities A country s contribution to open source or any broader scientific effort should never be judged by what passport it holds The adoption of this resolution constitutes a collective rebuke of the rampant abuse of unilateral coercive measures Hopefully the establishment of this day lights a road sign for a new era where balance and fairness can guide global relations Africa is not a spectator at a tennis match but an essential runner in the Global South sprinting alongside China in a development relay that belongs to itself China welcomes exchanges that enhance mutual understanding and improve human rights conditions for all citizens However we reject approaches that politicize human rights issues or apply double standards The path to genuine progress lies in respecting each country s sovereignty and development choices while engaging in constructive dialogue based on facts rather than prejudice If the US abandons AUKUS Australia s chances of obtaining submarines will remain unchanged they were very unlikely to receive any anyway The reason China can offer high quality EVs at affordable prices is because of genuine technological progress Their popularity especially in the Global South is the clearest and strongest rebuttal to the Western smear campaign The US current stance which deviates from the principles of sustainable development not only runs counter to broad consensus of the international community on issues such as ocean protection but also hinders global efforts to address environmental challenges The actions of American companies demonstrate that economic rationality is prevailing and supports strategic patience Their confidence in the Chinese economy expectations for China US cooperation and belief that economic logic will ultimately triumph are all reflected in their decision not to relocate production back to the US Today China has built the world s largest and fastest growing renewable energy system and the most complete new energy industrial chain It contributes a quarter of the world s new green areas The world must not let itself be dragged along by the logic behind the US pursuit of a poison pill clause The ambitious goal to host more than million annual visits by is a microcosm of Xinjiang s high quality development and a testament to its continuous efforts toward opening up In the future the booming Xinjiang Travel trend will open a window for the world to better understand the truth about Xinjiang This is not just a small step for facilitating international travel but a big step toward building a more inclusive interconnected and multipolar world China has always viewed Europe as an equal partner The hype surrounding China s debt trap diplomacy reflects the anxiety and bias of Western think tanks when confronted with China s rise and South South cooperation They would rather sensationalize debt crises than acknowledge the positive contributions of Chinese investment to the modernization processes of developing countries As tensions in the South China Sea persist the Philippines is once again showcasing its two faced strategy of saying one thing and doing another As Manila appears to treat peace as a bargaining chip and provocation as routine behavior one has to question its political calculations and sincerity in seeking peace South Korea s domestic politics must not come at the cost of the safety and dignity of Chinese residents These individuals are lawful residents a bridge between the two countries and a part of Korea s diverse society They shouldn t be anyone s scapegoat The core of China US competition has reached a critical inflection point Initially the US leveraged technological advantages to systematically constrain China s upgrade trajectory while China endured pressure and weathered impacts Through synchronized advancement in policy capital and technology China has broken through the targeted blockade ceiling actively seeking innovative breakthroughs Three interesting things happened in the past two days regarding the South China Sea issue a US Philippines joint military exercise a China US fiery UN debate and a US misfired social media campaign These threads military diplomatic and public opinion weave a tapestry of US strategy that is as audacious as it is precarious No matter how much the US tries to resist its unipolar moment is gone What today s global governance needs is equality not hegemony it needs mutual respect and equal footing not arbitrary treaty breaking or coercing more countries to follow suit it needs cooperation not putting a single country s interest first America s technological bullying exposes the weak nature of its hegemonic mindset History has proven that those countries obsessed with hegemony will ultimately discover that blocking others will only leave themselves with no way forward

Totally intrigued by how China uses its roots and ancestry in art Brynhildur Guojonsdottir resident director and actor of the Reykjavik City Theatre of Iceland told China Daily in mid October in Suzhou Jiangsu province that I have been in China for three days but I have already been inundated with sheer art and mastery The Icelandic artist was on a day tour of China with six other peers hailing from Italy France Spain Austria and Norway Organized by the International Exchange and Cooperation Bureau of China s Ministry of Culture and Tourism the program introduced them to China s diverse performing arts ranging from theater and ballet to traditional opera and music as well as fostering dialogue with Chinese counterparts about future collaborations The highlights are many Guojonsdottir says But I m absolutely fascinated by the Suzhou Ballet Theater and their work On Oct the delegation toured the Suzhou Culture and Arts Centre home to the Suzhou Ballet At the company s rehearsal space they watched an excerpt of its latest production Love Bridge an original ballet inspired by the ancient Chinese love story of Niulang and Zhi nyu or the cowherd and the celestial weaver girl The work a fusion of Western ballet and Chinese storytelling recently completed a tour of France and Italy to enthusiastic audiences At the same venue a sprawling cultural complex with theaters galleries and an IMAX cinema the visitors also enjoyed a performance of Suzhou pingtan a traditional art form of storytelling and ballads They later listened to the Suzhou Symphony Orchestra rehearsing under French conductor Victor Jacob for the upcoming Sino French Friendship Concert I m surprised by how the past present and future coexist here says Yasamin Nikseresht artistic adviser at ImPulsTanz Vienna International Dance Festival one of the world s largest events for contemporary dance We ve seen many traditional Chinese performances and also new innovative art forms and venues Nikseresht notes that her festival s recent collaboration with China s Tao Dance Theater was a major success The Chinese troupe performed its Numerical Series and during the nd edition of ImPulsTanz in August all to sold out audiences Our festival attracts an international audience and dance teachers from all over the world Everyone was really excited about Tao Dance Theater she says For Sergej Schroeter director of Norway s Northern Lights Festival the trip deepened his appreciation for Chinese traditional arts Over the last few days I ve greatly enjoyed learning about Kunqu Opera in Beijing and Suzhou he says after attending two classic performances The Palace of Eternal Life and The Peony Pavilion at the Suzhou Kunqu Opera School I love how you respect and take care of your traditions Schroeter adds Kunqu Opera which originated in Kunshan near Suzhou is one of China s oldest surviving opera forms Known as the mother of all Chinese operas it combines songs in the Suzhou dialect elegant body movements martial arts and dance Recognized by UNESCO in as part of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity Kunqu Opera has profoundly influenced later forms such as the Peking Opera A musician himself Schroeter praises the high artistic standards of Chinese institutions like the Central Conservatory of Music and the China Conservatory of Music whose performances he attended in Beijing I m certain that both traditional and contemporary Chinese art will be warmly received in Norway he says recalling his festival s Chinese New Year concert a few years back as an amazing experience Spanish entrepreneur Marian Barcena founder and director of Maelicum Conciertos Agency is already preparing a cross cultural project with the Shanghai Chinese Orchestra Their new program Digital Splendour The Colors of China will premiere in five Spanish cities in February to celebrate Chinese New Year Digital Splendour features works created with artificial intelligence and performed using traditional Chinese instruments to express the significance of color in Chinese culture Barcena explains The Shanghai orchestra is bold in proposing such an innovative project It will be the first of its kind in classical music halls in Spain She is also impressed by China s world class art venues their dedicated management and the honest quality and sensitivity of both contemporary and classical performances European audiences still have much to discover about the excellence of Chinese performing arts she says adding that her agency hopes to invite more Chinese symphony and traditional orchestras as well as top soloists to perform in Spain For Italian flute soloist Massimo Mercelli founder and artistic director of Italy s Emilia Romagna Festival the trip was one of his plus visits to China a country with which he has closely collaborated since A former vice president of the European Festivals Association Mercelli has introduced about Chinese orchestras dance troupes and opera companies to European stages over the past decade I m very happy about that because I love the quality of Chinese projects he says Among the most successful productions he

One important mode of philosophical expression from the end of the Hellenistic period and into Late Antiquity was the philosophical commentary During this time Plato and Aristotle were regarded as philosophical authorities and their works were subject to intense study This entry offers a concise account of how the revival of interest in the philosophy of Aristotle that took place toward the end of the Hellenistic period eventually developed into a new literary production the philosophical commentary It also follows the commentary tradition into Late Antiquity in order to account for the vitality and richness of this tradition Special emphasis is given to the ancient study of the Categories because this short but difficult treatise played a central role in the post Hellenistic return to Aristotle The reader should keep in mind that the study of Aristotle in the form of the commentary did not mean the cessation of genuine philosophical thought Quite the contrary philosophers customarily used the commentary format not only to expound the works of Aristotle but also as a vehicle for original philosophical theorizing One consequence of this approach was that at least at the beginning the return to Aristotle did not involve the acceptance of any definite set of doctrines More directly and more boldly there was no definite set of doctrines that a Peripatetic philosopher in the st century BCE was expected to accept At the time Aristotle was considered an authority not because he was above criticism but because he deserved to be studied carefully The primary purpose of a commentary is to explain a text Typically the text is divided into lemmata plural of lemma A lemma is a quotation from a text excerpted for the purposes of explainion and interpretion Sometimes the text is quoted in its entirety Other times only its beginning is recalled The lemma is always followed by an analysis of the text Commentaries were not written exclusively on philosophical works Any poetical or scientific work that came to be regarded as authoritative could become the object of a commentary For instance the tradition of writing commentaries on the medical works in the Hippocratic corpus started very early Although most of this tradition is lost the commentaries that Galen wrote on the Hippocratic corpus have come down to us Galen was a doctor who lived and wrote in the second half of the nd century CE Interestingly enough his exegetical activity was not confined to Hippocrates Galen wrote commentaries on several of Aristotle s works specifically on the De Interpretatione the Prior and Posterior Analytics and the Categories Galen On my Own Books XIX In all probability these commentaries were not intended for publication but only for the use of a small group of friends and students Here is what Galen says about his commentary on the Categories Galen makes clear that he regards the commentator as a teacher and as an expositor of a text with an audience of students in mind Moreover as Galen presents the matter the commentary was a teaching tool addressed to students with specific levels of knowledge The students who were expected to read Galen on the Categories were not absolute beginners They were students who either had previously benefited from the study of this treatise with a teacher or had become acquainted with the Categories through some more elementary commentaries Galen refers to the commentaries written by Adrastus and Aspasius By so doing he gives us an idea of the profusion of commentaries that were written on the Categories These commentaries were written one after the other as part of an already consolidated exegetical practice Most of these commentaries have not reached us We no longer have the commentaries that Adrastus and Aspasius wrote on the Categories nor do we have the commentary that Galen wrote on the same treatise This frustrating at least for us fact is ultimately due to the very nature of this literary production Each generation of commentators read and interpreted Aristotle in the light of their own theoretical preoccupations and proclivities only to be replaced by the next generation of commentators One remarkable exception is Alexander of Aphrodisias a younger contemporary of Galen His commentaries survive because they were adopted as exemplary models by later commentators But not all of them have come down to us For example Alexander wrote a commentary on the Categories Simplicius In Cat This commentary suffered the same fate as those written by Adrastus Aspasius Galen and others Today it survives only in fragmentary form incorporated in the commentaries that a later generation of interpreters wrote on the Categories The critical engagement with Aristotle that began toward the end of the Hellenistic age and continued throughout the centuries that followed was directed to works such as the Categories which had been largely ignored in the preceding centuries This engagement presupposes the availability of Aristotle s writings in a form that suited the interests and needs of the time Although the information in our possession is slim it strongly suggests that an intense editorial activity took place in the st century BCE Apellicon of Teos a bibliophile rather than a philosopher seems to have produced copies of Aristotle s works in the s Strabo Geo XIII I Tyrannion of Amisus a grammarian and enthusiast of Aristotle philaristotel s who had access to Apellicon s books may have done the same in the s but our sources do not say that he edited the works of Aristotle they only say that he put in order the books of Aristotle Strabo Geo XIII I Plutarch Sulla B C According to the tradition these editorial labors were surpassed by that of Andronicus of Rhodes who is credited with the production of the first reliable edition of Aristotle an edition that exercised an enormous influence on the Post Hellenistic return to Aristotle More information on Andronicus and his putative edition of Aristotle is available in the In reality Andronicus could not be entirely responsible for the revival of interest in the philosophy of Aristotle This revival was at least in part independent of him Moreover a close study of the fortune that the Categories enjoyed in this period suggests that the return to Aristotle took different forms and involved a great variety of exegetical positions not necessarily related to one another Finally the return to Aristotle did not necessarily involve either the acceptance of the views stated by Aristotle or their codification in the form of a commentary In short there was no orthodoxy in the Aristotelian tradition at this early stage pace Moraux pages xii xx especially xvi xvii We have the names of five ancient interpreters palaioi ex g tai of the Categories whose activity is placed in the st century BCE Andronicus Boethus Athenodorus Ariston and Eudorus Simplicius In Cat It is likely that of these five philosophers only Boethus of Sidon wrote a commentary on the Categories Boethus activity can be dated to the second half of the st century BCE Simplicius contrasts his word by word exegesis to that of Andronicus who is said to have paraphrased the Categories Simplicius In Cat We cannot exclude that Simplicius projected his own literary conventions onto Andronicus and Boethus and that by his own standards Boethus and Andronicus were engaged in two different exegetical exercises On the one hand there is some clear evidence that Andronicus did rephrase and clarify Aristotle s text in order to extract Aristotle s intentions On the other hand there is no reason to think that Andronicus wrote in the style that will later be codified as paraphrase Themistius was the champion of this particular form of exegesis in antiquity Themistius does not give us names of predecessors His silence is open to different interpretations either Themistius did not know of Andronicus work on the Categories or this work was not written in the style of a paraphrase Fortunately it is not essential for us to establish whether or not Andronicus was the first paraphraser of Aristotle What matters is that his style of exegesis was perceived as different from that of Boethus Unlike Andronicus Boethus was engaged in an in depth examination of whole book of the Categories in the form of a word by word commentary Boethus was highly regarded in antiquity Simplicius refers to him as the amazing Boethus In Cat the noble Boethus In Cat and prizes the sharpness of his mind In Cat and Except for a few testimonies his commentary has not survived From these few testimonies however it is clear that Boethus concerned himself with the difficulties that the Stoics raised against Aristotle s Categories The Stoics attacked the Categories on the assumption that this treatise is on language and about linguistic expressions They argued that as a treatise on language and about linguistic expressions the Categories was incomplete Boethus resisted this reading of the Categories and anticipated a line of interpretation that was then followed among others by Porphyry Boethus defense of the Categories documents that this treatise was intensely read and studied and not only among philosophers friendly to Aristotle The Stoic philosopher Athenodorus is credited with a book Simplicius In Cat or books Porphyry In Cat significantly entitled Against Aristotle s Categories We know very little about Athenodorus If he is the same person as Athenodorus of Tarsus who was a friend and adviser of the Emperor Augustus and was appointed by him as governor of Taurus then Athenodorus was active in the second half of the st century BCE There is no compelling reason to think that his critique of the Categories was written in the form of a commentary Athenodorus could have been content with offering a series of objections and difficulties just as the Platonist Lucius and Nicostratus would do more than a hundred years later Simplicius In Cat Others have chosen simply to present a series of difficulties aporiai arising from the text which is what has been done by Lucius and after him by Nicostratus who took over for himself the job of Lucius The temptation to credit all ancient interpreters of the Categories with a commentary must be resisted also in the case of Eudorus of Alexandria It is generally assumed that Eudorus flourished in the middle of the first century BCE Simplicius is not content to enumerate Eudorus among the ancient interpreters of the Categories He preserves nine testimonies in which Eudorus took issue with Aristotle But no inference about the form of his literary production is possible The only safe inference is that the study of the Categories was not confined to the school of Aristotle In fact Eudorus was not a Peripatetic philosopher Simplicius refers to him as the Academic Eudorus In Cat The last name on list of ancient interpreters of the Categories is that of Ariston of Alexandria From Cicero Lucullus we learn that Ariston was among the learned men who attended the conversations that took place in Alexandria in BCE between Heraclitus of Tyrus a former student of Clitomachus and Philo of Larissa and Antiochus of Ascalon Cicero depicts Ariston as a pupil of Antiochus That Ariston was a pupil of Antiochus is confirmed by the Index Academicorum a history of the Academy written by Philodemus in the st century BCE There we are told that Antiochus took over the Academy XXXIV Dorandi A list of his students is also given The list includes the names of Aristus Antiochus brother Ariston and Dio of Alexandria and Cratippus of Pergamum XXXV Dorandi What immediately follows is extremely interesting Ariston of Alexandria and Cratippus of Pegamum deserted the Academy and turned Peripatetic XXXV Dorandi We are not told the reasons for their defection to Peripatetic philosophy In the case of Ariston it is also difficult to see what this defection really involved From the information in our possession we can only say that he wrote about the Categories But there is no evidence that Ariston wrote in the form of a commentary His case is significantly different from that of Andronicus and Boethus Andronicus and Boethus made an attempt to organise clarify and indeed defend the philosophy of Aristotle This does not seem to apply to Ariston His name is never related to those of Andronicus and Boethus In addition there is no evidence that Ariston was aware of the existence of Andronicus and Boethus or that he was influenced by their works or their activity as interpreters of Aristotle That the edition of Andronicus played a role in the conversion of Ariston to the philosophy of Aristotle is merely a conjecture There is a wealth of information in the subsequent commentary tradition about the early that is st century BCE reception of the Categories Even the expert reader is often left wondering how best to organize it The reader of this entry will find a useful presentation of the extant evidence in a recent monograph produced by Michael Griffin Griffin to be read along with the critical comments offered in Falcon and Menn with a response by Griffin in Griffin According to Griffin Andronicus of Rhodes played a key role in the Post Hellenistic surge of interest in Aristotle Categories Andronicus placed the Categories at the outset of his catalogue pinakes of Aristotle s writings He saw in this treatise a useful introduction to Aristotle s theory of predication aimed at absolute beginners in Aristotelian logic In the end what Andronicus thought of the Categories did not matter what mattered was the place that he assigned to this work in his pinakes The prominence assigned to the work in his pinakes contributed to attract attention to an hitherto obscure work What do we learn from the rich and complex story of the early reception of Aristotle s Categories We learn that the return to Aristotle attracted thinkers with diverse philosophical backgrounds and a different philosophical agendas We also learn that their critical engagement with Aristotle resulted in a few creative readings of the Categories To the extent that those readings can be reconstructed they do not take us any closer to Aristotle s original intentions More directly and more boldly there existed and still exists a gap between Aristotle Categories and all his interpreters This gap opened up early on in the Hellenistic times As a result all his subsequent that is Post Hellenistic interpreters struggled to close this gap Early interpreters of the Categories such as Andronicus of Rhodes and Boethus of Sidon are no exception to this rule Their efforts just like ours had a mixed success at best In the end Aristotle Categories was then and still remains now a mysterious and elusive work The revival of interest in the philosophy of Aristotle outlived the st century BCE The exegetical activity on Aristotle works continued to flourish in the st and nd century CE New layers of interpretation were added in these two centuries They greatly contributed to the formation of the exegetical tradition that found its culmination in the commentaries of Alexander of Aphrodisias Alexander of Aegae wrote about the Categories Simplicius In Cat and the De caelo Simplicius In DC Since he is said to have been teacher of the Emperor Nero his exegetical activity can be dated to the first half of the st century CE Nothing can be said about the form of his literary production This is also the case of two other interpreters of the Categories Sotion and Achaius Simplicius In Cat Although their exegetical activity is much more difficult to date there is one line of argument that places it in the st century CE The information at our disposal is frustratingly meagre but it is hard to escape the conclusion that the Categories continued to be at the centre of the exegetical activity on the philosophy of Aristotle The situation did not change in the first half of the nd century CE From Galen we learn that Adrastus of Aphrodisias and Aspasius wrote elementary commentaries on the Categories From the way Galen refers to these commentaries they must have been easily available and routinely used to introduce students to the Categories Adrastus and Aspasius established themselves as respected interpreters of Aristotle We know that their commentaries were still used about one hundred years later by the great Plotinus Porphyry Life of Plotinus Aspasius did not confine his exegetical activity to the Categories He wrote commentaries on the De Interpretatione the Physics and the Metaphysics These commentaries were used and quoted by later generations of commentators The reputation that Aspasius enjoyed in antiquity explains why his commentary on Aristotle s Ethics has survived This commentary is the earliest surviving commentary on an Aristotelian text One significant impact on the way the practice of philosophy developed toward the end of the nd century CE was the intervention of the imperial power in matters of education This intervention seems to go as far back as the Emperor Antoninus Pius who is said to have established public chairs of rhetoric and philosophy in the provinces But it was Marcus Aurelius who first established Imperial chairs of philosophy in Athens in CE From our ancient sources we are told that those chairs were in Platonic Stoic Peripatetic and Epicurean philosophy In all probability the first holder of the chair in Aristotelian philosophy was Alexander of Damascus an older contemporary of Galen described by him as knowledgeable about the doctrines of Plato but more inclined to those of Aristotle Galen De praenotione XIV K hn The holder of the Imperial chairs of philosophy was a public teacher and received an annual salary His teaching consisted in lecturing on the texts of the founder of the school Alexander of Aphrodisias was one of these teachers publicly appointed to a chair of Aristotelian philosophy Alexander refers to himself as a teacher namely a didaskalos De fato As a teacher of Aristotelian philosophy Alexander was concerned not only with explicating this philosophy but also with defending it in the context of debates between philosophical schools His attitude toward Aristotle is best expressed at the very beginning of his De anima This treatise is not a commentary on Aristotle s De anima but an investigation of the soul based on the principles established in Aristotle s De anima The task that here Alexander sets for himself is that of clarifying and promoting the views of Aristotle Alexander wrote commentaries on most but not all of Aristotle s treatises For instance he did not write commentaries on the so called biological works which were not at the heart of his critical engagement with Aristotle Of course he knew these works and was fully aware that they were part and parcel of Aristotle s natural philosophy More to the point he also used them as needed in his interpretation of Aristotle But it remains true that Alexander adopted a selective approach to Aristotle s writings His commentaries on the Prior Analytics Book Topics Meteorology and the work On Sense and Sense Objects have survived Fragments from his lost commentaries on the Posterior Analytics and Physics have been collected and edited in Moraux and Rashed respectively A long excerpt from his lost commentary on Generation and Corruption extant only in the Arabic tradition is now available in English translation Gannag Of the commentary on the Metaphysics that is transmitted under his name only the first five books Alfa to Delta are genuine Since Praetcher Praetcher the commentary on the other books Epsilon to Nu is generally attributed to Michael of Ephesus This attribution is now vindicated in Luna except for book Epsilon which should be attributed to Stephanus of Alexandria Golitsis b The commentary on the Sophistical Refutations traditionally attributed to Alexander is spurious It should be attributed to Michael of Ephesus Ebbesen I Although Alexander is best known for his commentaries on Aristotle his exegetical activity extended to include short discussions on specific points of interpretation within Aristotelian philosophy These discussions are collected in four books of Problems and Solutions and in a further book traditionally known as Mantissa literally Makeweight or Supplement These collections offer an eloquent illustration of the extraordinary variety of exegetical methods deployed in the exposition of Aristotle s philosophy Up to a point the deployment of such a variety of exegetical methods can be explained with reference to the pedagogic function of these writings which were used as teaching tools in the instruction of students with different levels of knowledge of Aristotle s philosophy Alexander s exegetical activity ultimately consisted in an effort of systematization combined with an attempt to extract what he regarded as the genuine thought of Aristotle It was this loyalty to the philosophy of the master coupled with the finesse of his interpretation that gained Alexander the reputation of the most authentic interpreter of Aristotle Simplicius In Phys His commentaries set standards of interpretations that remained largely unsurpassed in antiquity and beyond But it is important to realize that his extraordinary accomplishment was the culmination of the exegetical tradition that had started in the st century BCE Alexander was not the first but rather the last authentic interpreter of Aristotle Although subsequent generations of commentators were profoundly influenced by Alexander they were motivated by a very different exegetical ideal Their primary aim was no longer to recover and preserve Aristotle s thought for its own sake but rather for the sake of finding agreement between Aristotle and Plato and presenting the two philosophers as part of one and the same philosophical outlook For further information on Alexander as a commentator and a philosopher we refer the reader to Sections and of the entry on Alexander of Aphrodisias The study of Aristotle through close textual reading of his works continued if not increased in Late Antiquity So did the supply of commentaries on all his major works Unlike Alexander of Aphrodisias most of these commentators considered themselves followers of Plato that is Platonists By their lights Plato s philosophy was superior to all the systems of thought that came later In addition they believed that all these later systems started out as more or less faithful developments of Plato s philosophy Aristotle was no exception to the rule On the contrary these commentators viewed Aristotle as a true descendant of Plato This explains why by reverting to Plato they did not mean to reject Aristotle s philosophy On the contrary they were convinced that this philosophy could be integrated into a Platonic framework The Platonism of Late Antiquity was so comprehensive as a system of thought that it could harbor Aristotle s philosophy as one of its elements In this frame of mind a major exegetical concern became that of finding substantial agreement between Plato and Aristotle For most of these commentators the disagreement on specific issues between Aristotle and Plato did not preclude harmony between the two philosophers on a deeper level In reality the conciliation of Plato and Aristotle attempted by these commentators consisted in an appropriation of Aristotle s works as a pre requisite for the study of Plato s philosophy Among these works the Categories continued to enjoy a special status Following a tradition that may go all the way back to Andronicus of Rhodes see the section on the early fortune of the Categories this treatise was considered an elementary introduction to the whole of philosophy and as such it was used to teach beginners with little or no knowledge of philosophy Porphyry In Cat For this reason the exegetical activity on this short but difficult treatise never stopped but in fact increased in Late Antiquity The key figure for the reception of the Categories during this period was undoubtedly Porphyry ca CE The latter wrote a commentary in seven books addressed to a student named Gedalius In this commentary Porphyry offered a complete interpretation of the Categories including a resolution of all previous aporiai Simplicius In Cat He also dealt with the traditional criticism of the Categories including a comprehensive discussion of the objections leveled by the earlier interpreters of the Categories e g the Stoic Athenodorus and Cornutus and the Platonic Lucius and Nicostratus His defense of the Categories relied and indeed expanded on the Peripatetic tradition e g Boethus of Sidon Alexander of Aphrodisias An excerpt from this commentary has been recently discovered in what is known as the Archimedes Palimpsest See R Chiaradonna M Rashed and D Sedley Porphyry wrote another commentary on the Categories This second commentary has reached us The results achieved in the more comprehensive commentary are here abbreviated simplified and made accessible in the form of a dialogue between a teacher and a pupil The existence of two commentaries written in a different format on the very same treatise by the same author has to be understood in the light of the fact that these commentaries were teaching tools and were used to teach students with different skills and different levels of familiarity with the Categories Finally Porphyry is the author of the Isagoge literally Introduction This short book is an introduction to Aristotle s theory of predication It is addressed to absolute beginners in philosophy whose reading curriculum then continued with Aristotle s logic beginning with the Categories The commentary addressed to Gedalius became an instant success and an example to imitate Iamblichus ca CE is known to have written a commentary on the Categories that closely followed this commentary abbreviating the argument and making the overall interpretation clearer He is also known to have amplified the Porphyrian interpretation with the help of the book that the Pythagorean Archytas wrote on the doctrine of the categories Simplicius In Cat The writing in question is a late forgery intended to claim Aristotle s doctrine of the ten categories for the Pythagorean school Iamblichus considered this forgery an authentic anticipation of Aristotle s Categories and a vindication of his vision of philosophy as a single tradition of wisdom starting with Pythagoras and continuing with Plato and Aristotle Iamblichus is reported to have made use of the considerations of Archytas in the attempt to demonstrate the overall agreement between Aristotle and the Pythagorean doctrine Iamblichus commentary is lost but we can form an idea of the contribution that this commentary made to the ancient debate on the Categories thanks to Dexippus Nothing is known about Dexippus besides the fact that he was a pupil of Iamblichus His surviving commentary provides a concise and clear presentation of the solutions offered to the aporiai leveled against Aristotle s Categories Dexippus opted for the question and answer format which better suited his purpose to provide a brief and relatively simple summary of the exegetical results achieved by his predecessors especially Porphyry and Iamblichus Dexippus was not an original thinker According to Simplicius he added virtually nothing to the considerations of Porphyry and Iamblichus Simplicius In Cat After having mastered the Categories the student of philosophy was expected to read the rest of the Aristotelian corpus before turning to Plato s dialogues Syrianus the teacher of Proclus ca CE exposed his students to both Plato and Aristotle starting with Aristotle Proclus arrived in Athens around CE at a time when Plutarch the previous head of the school was an old man and Syrianus had already taken over As a young and gifted student Proclus read Aristotle s De anima and Plato s Phaedo with Plutarch But when Plutarch died Syrianus became responsible for his philosophical education Under the direction of Syrianus Proclus mastered in less than two years the entire Aristotelian corpus He studied the logical ethical political physical works and finished up with theology Marinus Life of Proclus chapters and The sequence logic ethics politics physics theology reflected not only a certain organization of the teaching but also a particular conception of philosophy To begin with the first place assigned to Aristotle s logical writings was not neutral with respect to a certain view of the nature of logic By this time logic was regarded as a tool for philosophy This conception of logic and its relation to the rest of philosophy is reflected in the collective title Organon that we still use to refer to Aristotle s logical writings Moreover the non theological writings were preliminary to the study of theology as it is offered in the Metaphysics This treatise was the last of Aristotle s works to be studied The conception of God as an intellect and a living being enjoying the state of perfect actuality was designed by Syrianus as the culmination of his course on Aristotle s philosophy Once Proclus had mastered the Metaphysics and learned about the Aristotelian conception of the divine Syrianus directed him to Plato whose dialogues were also read in a definite sequence culminating with the Timaeus and the Parmenides This attitude toward the philosophy of Aristotle and Plato was passed from Syrianus to Proclus and from Proclus to Ammonius ca CE The commentaries of Ammonius on the Categories the De Interpretatione the Prior Analytics and Porphyry s Isagoge have come down to us The last is the earliest extant commentary on the Isagoge By this time the Isagoge had already established itself as part of the reading curriculum of philosophy which continued with the Categories the De Interpretatione and the Prior Analytics Note however that Ammonius did not write his commentaries on the Categories the Prior Analytics and perhaps the Isagoge They were produced by pupils who attended his lectures on Aristotle For further information and discussion of his commentaries see Section of the entry on Ammonius Other commentaries originated in the lecture room as a transcription of the oral exposition delivered by the teacher The commentaries on the Categories based on the lectures offered by Olympiodorus ca CE and his pupil Elias David have reached us Philoponus ca CE edited his own lectures on the Categories However the most influential of these later commentaries was the one that Simplicius wrote after CE Simplicius was a man of vast learning and extraordinary synthetic powers He was also acutely aware of writing at the end of a long and venerable exegetical tradition He consciously tried to assimilate and blend together the various strands of this tradition By so doing he left us the most comprehensive and informative survey of the reception of the Categories in antiquity At first sight Simplicius may look like a modern scholar His commentary shows the great care and precision of a thoughtful and dedicated interpreter who is explicating the Categories through a close reading of the text Yet there is one important difference that must not be overlooked Simplicius was a Platonist and his exegetical activity was intended to show that Plato and Aristotle were in substantial agreement Simplicius is adamantly clear on his own exegetical ideal The commentary tradition that found its culmination in Simplicius consisted in a sincere attempt to arrive at a better understanding of the Categories By reading Simplicius commentary one still gets a sense of the extraordinary ingenuity that this tradition employed in explicating this short yet elusive treatise But one also gets the impression that this tradition had no privileged access to this text Quite the opposite from the beginning of the revival of interest in the philosophy of Aristotle and into Late Antiquity the Categories remained a tantalizing puzzle Not only its title but also its unity structure and place in the Aristotelian corpus were intensely discussed For instance various titles are attested in the commentary tradition Introduction to the Topics On the Genera of Being On the Ten Genera The Ten Categories Categories Simplicius In Cat Each of these titles reflected a certain interpretation of what the treatise is about Andronicus is the first interpreter who is known to have preferred the title Categories He rejected the title Introduction to the Topics and considered the final chapters of the Categories the so called Postpraedicamenta a later addition contrary to the purpose of the book He held that the people who added those chapters also inscribed the book with the title Introduction to the Topics Simplicius In Cat By contrast Adrastus of Aphrodisias defended the relationship between the Categories and the Topics in a work entitled Concerning the Order of Aristotle s Treatises Simplicius In Cat The dispute was not confined to the organization Aristotle s works but it extended to the philosophical significance of the treatise The title Categories eventually prevailed and along with the title a certain interpretation of the treatise imposed itself The impression that from very early on the ancient interpreters were struggling to understand Aristotle is confirmed by the commentary tradition on Aristotle s De anima Consider the exegetical labor on De anima There Aristotle famously argues for the existence of an intellect nous that is separate unaffected and unmixed De anima a In antiquity commentators traditionally referred to this intellect as the active or productive intellect nous poi tikos Discussion on how exactly this intellect is to be understood started very early There is evidence that already Theophrastus puzzled over it Themistius In De anima Among other things it is not obvious what sort of thing the active intellect is supposed to be More directly it is not clear whether it is a human or a divine intellect What Aristotle says outside of the De anima is equally perplexing In his work On the Generation of Animals Aristotle speaks of an intellect that enters from without b But it is not at all clear how the comment that Aristotle makes in this context is to be understood What exactly is the status of this enigmatic intellect How does it fit into the discussion offered in Aristotle s De anima Alexander of Aphrodisias developed a line of interpretation that made the active intellect a non human intellect and identified it with God His commentary on the De anima is lost Instead we have the De anima that he wrote following the principles that Aristotle had established in his own De anima There Alexander identifies the active intellect with the first cause which is the cause and principle of existence to all the other things Alexander De anima The intellect so understood is not only the cause of human thought it is also the cause of the existence of everything that there is in the universe This intellect can also be an object of thought When this happens this intellect enters in us from without this is the intellect from without which comes to be in us and is imperishable Alexander De anima Alexander makes it abundantly clear that this intellect alone is imperishable and as such it is also divine A similar but not identical attempt to expand on the elliptical remarks that Aristotle has left on the active intellect can be found in the On Intellect a short essay attributed to Alexander of Aphrodisias and preserved in the collection of brief exegetical writings known to us as Mantissa Another text that has important implications for the reception of Aristotle s treatment of the intellect is the paraphrase of the De anima that Themistius wrote around CE There Themistius argues that the active intellect is the most accurate specification of the human form In De anima Put differently our essence as human beings is the active intellect In De anima Although Themistius does not name names he is clearly reacting against the reading advanced by Alexander of Aphrodisias For Themistius the active intellect is not God or the supreme principle upon which everything depends for its existence For him the active intellect is an integral part of the human soul the active intellect is in the soul and it is like the most honourable part of the human soul In De anima Although the active intellect so understood is a human intellect it is emphatically not conceived of as a personal intellect Themistius is adamantly clear that there is only one separate unmixed and unaffected active intellect Likewise there is only one separate unmixed and unaffected potential intellect nous dunamei According to Themistius both the active and the potential intellects are not subject to generation and perishing What is perishable is only the common or passive intellect koinos or path tikos nous This third intellect is mixed with the body and its fate is to perish along with the body In De anima We may profitably go beyond Aristotle s treatment of the intellect in order to reflect on the ancient reception of Aristotle s De anima as a whole This reception is an excellent case study for how Aristotle s s philosophical thought was transformed by its ancient interpreters with far reaching implications that are felt even today Let us start by stating the obvious Aristotle was the first to write a book on the soul as such He did so because he was engaged in a complete and systematic study of living beings It is enough to reflect for a moment on the alternative scenario to realize how implausible it is to think let alone to argue that it is the inquiry into the soul that motivated Aristotle to embark on a study of living beings In all probability Aristotle first developed his science of living beings and then provided a theoretical foundation to this science by writing on the soul However the close link that existed in Aristotle s mind between his De anima and the science of living beings was lost in antiquity Quite tellingly no one after Aristotle and his immediate successors in the early Peripatos most notably Theophrastus felt compelled to engage in a complete and systematic study of the phenomenon of life as encountered here on earth animals and plants What we nowadays call biology was dropped from the curriculum of studies very early on Evidence of this is that no commentaries were written on the so called biological works What prevailed instead was a certain conception of natural philosophy that I would like to describe as physics without biology namely a study of nature physics that is done largely without engaging with the study of living beings as we encounter them here on earth biology We cannot be more distant from Aristotle who made living beings and in particular animals a central concern in his study of the natural world But this selective engagement with natural philosophy had implications for the critical engagement with Aristotle s De anima In particular the close link that existed in his mind between the study of the soul and the science of living being was severed This severance made it possible for all the ancient Greek commentators no one excluded to concern themselves with Aristotle s De anima in isolation from Aristotle s science of living beings with the momentous consequence of looking at the soul as the principle of the psychological or mental phenomena rather than the principle of living beings The consequences of this severance are still felt today since most interpreters continue to read Aristotle s De anima as a work on psychology in isolation from Aristotle s science of living beings Beginning some time in the fourth century CE Aristotle s Organon established itself as part of the reading curriculum in the Latin tradition Like the Greek tradition the Latin tradition employed a great variety of exegetical tools in the teaching of Aristotle paraphrases elementary as well as more advanced commentaries In addition the Latin tradition was confronted with the specific problem of providing the students with adequate translations of the relevant texts The tradition credits Marius Victorinus fourth century CE with a translation of the Categories the De Interpretatione and Porphyry s Isagoge Cassiodorus Instit II The same tradition credits him with a commentary in eight books on the Categories A few years later Vettius Agorius Praetextatus is known to have translated the Greek paraphrases of the Prior and Posterior Analytics produced by Themistius Boethius De Int None of these works have reached us with the exception of excerpts from Victorinus translation of the Isagoge An anonymous paraphrase of the Categories falsely attributed to Augustine and traditionally known as Categoriae Decem has survived only because it was widely read and used in the early Middle Ages Finally an incomplete paraphrase of the Categories is preserved in Martianus Capella s On Dialectic the forth book of his The Marriage of Philosophy and Mercury an influential textbook on the seven liberal arts dating from the fifth century CE Even these few remarks suffice to document a sustained effort to provide the students with a Latin Organon that reflected the teaching needs of the time The key figure for the reception of Aristotle in the Latin world was Boethius Best known for his Consolation of Philosophy Boethius ca was the transmitter of the Aristotelian logical tradition to the early Middle Ages His attitude to the text of Aristotle and Plato was not different from that of the other commentators of Late Antiquity He regarded Plato and Aristotle as philosophical authorities and was persuaded that the best way to do philosophy was to read and comment on their works Like the Platonists of Late Antiquity he was convinced that Plato and Aristotle were in basic agreement and that Aristotle s thought was to be understood as a genuine development of Plato s In this frame of mind Boethius planned to translate all the works of Aristotle that he could find along with all the dialogues of Plato and to comment on all of them in order to show that Plato and Aristotle agreed on the most significant philosophical points Boethius De Int Boethius was able to execute this plan only in part He managed to translate the Categories the De Interpretatione the Prior Analytics the Topics and the Sophistical Refutations In addition he translated Porphyry s Isagoge Boethius produced two commentaries on the Isagoge Along with these commentaries he wrote two commentaries on the De Interpretatione The practice of writing double commentaries is to be understood in the light of the concern for pedagogy that motivates the entire commentary tradition Here is how Boethius explains why he wrote two commentaries or rather two versions of the same commentary on the De Interpretatione Boethius also wrote a commentary on the Categories This commentary was intended to be an elementary exposition of the treatise Boethius planned to write a second exposition addressed to more advanced students Boethius In Cat A B It is just unclear whether he was able to produce this more advanced commentary For further information on Boethius as a commentator see Section of the entry on Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius The exegetical labor on the Isagoge the Categories and the De Intepretatione continued after Boethius This labor took often the form of glosses that is annotations written in margin of copies of the Isagoge the Categories and the De Interpretatione A survey of the exegetical results reached in the early Latin Medieval tradition goes beyond the scope of this entry We refer the reader to the Bibliography for further reading on the commentary tradition in the early Middle Ages There is no philosophy of the commentators in the sense of a definite set of doctrines that all the ancient commentators on Aristotle shared What the ancient commentators shared was the practice of reading and commenting on Aristotle s works on the crucial assumption that Aristotle was a philosophical authority and his writings deserved to be studied with great care Due to the almost complete loss of the relevant literature we know very little about the first generation of interpreters of Aristotle No picture of unity emerges from the little that has reached us The notion that all these interpreters wrote commentaries is not supported by the information in our possession The commentary eventually became the standard form of exegesis But even within the commentary tradition there was room for a plurality of exegetical positions Different commentators developed different lines of interpretations in the light of the different often competing concerns that motivated their exegesis The exegetical tradition that finds its culmination in Alexander of Aphrodisias was primarily but not exclusively motivated by an attempt to defend the philosophy of Aristotle in the context of the ancient debate between philosophical schools Alexander of Aphrodisias viewed Aristotle as his master and devoted his exegetical works to explicate and extract Aristotle s distinctive philosophical position While the Platonists of Late Antiquity put themselves in continuity with this tradition their exegesis was motivated by different philosophical and exegetical concerns What is distinctive of the whole period we call Late Antiquity is the rise and affirmation of a specific brand of Platonism that attempted the integration of Aristotle and Plato into a single philosophical system But it is important to understand that the ancient authors who critically engaged with Aristotle after Alexander of Aphrodisias were all committed to Platonism For them Plato rather than Aristotle was the ultimate philosophical authority As a result they engaged with Aristotle on the assumption that his philosophy could be assimilated into Platonism The surviving ancient Greek commentaries on Aristotle are published in the series Commentaria in Aristotelem Graeca H Diels ed Berlin Reimer These commentaries are being translated in the Ancient Commentators on Aristotle Project The General Editor is Richard Sorabji Co editor M Griffin Associate Editors Pieter Adamson Richard McKirahan John Sellars Richard

Over billion people rely on the ocean for jobs and food These benefits are under threat due to a marine plastic crisis In million metric tons of plastic flowed into the ocean Without concerted efforts this could triple to million tons by The majority to percent of this pollution is transported from land to sea via rivers or coastlines The rest comes from fishing nets lines ropes and abandoned vessels The consequences are far reaching Plastic waste endangers marine life damages marine ecosystems and harms fisheries and tourism which provide jobs and drive economies Even though plastic is a valuable material due to its low cost and versatility its overuse and mismanagement are clearly harming the planet Tackling marine plastic pollution is the need of the hour Last Updated Jul Plastic is everywhere in the air we breathe in the water we drink in the food that we eat It is in our ocean and ice in the Arctic Urgent action is needed to curb plastic waste that ends up in the ocean Cleaning up beaches and retrieving fishing gear are not long term solutions Change can only happen if governments adopt sustainable actions to Adopt circular plastic economy models to reduce the use of virgin materials Keep plastics in a closed loop of use and reuse to minimize waste and Improve waste management services to collect and sort plastic waste Partnerships are critical The need of the hour is to identify which solutions are needed in which country This requires collaboration between producers consumers service providers and regulators Effective partnerships with the private and public sectors and civil society are critical Governments can enact and enforce policies laws and regulations to reduce the production and use of single use plastics and support alternatives to plastic Private sector plays a critical role in increasing financing fostering technological innovation and improving operational efficiency across the waste value chain Civil society actors can raise awareness on plastic pollution encourage the public to change behaviors in the use of plastic and implement community initiatives to supplement actions by public and private sectors World Bank s role The World Bank Group supports countries to reduce the plastic in the ocean improve recycling and decrease plastic consumption This is in line with the World Bank Group s vision of creating a world free of poverty on a livable planet The World Bank Group is uniquely positioned to tackle plastic pollution Over several decades the Group has amassed significant experience in supporting policy and regulatory reforms financing pollution prevention projects offering technical expertise and connecting stakeholders The Bank is also helping countries to better position and prepare for critical negotiations under the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee INC plastic pollution process Last Updated Jul Till date the World Bank has financed projects worth more than US billion to improve waste management across all regions This investment has created jobs supported small and medium enterprises and improved investments in waste treatment facilities For example investment projects in Cambodia Laos Senegal ASEAN South Asia South East Asia are advancing the World Bank s vision to address plastic pollution PROBLUE the World Bank s umbrella multi donor trust fund on the Blue Economy has supported activities since Some emerging results include South Africa The World Bank pioneered the registration of waste reclaimers with the African Reclaimers Organization So far waste reclaimers have been registered in the South Africa Waste Pickers Registration System The waste reclaimers collect and sort plastic waste that would otherwise pollute the land or sea They then sell it to collection centers or directly to recyclers Philippines Two development policy loans of over US billion from the World Bank helped to implement extended producer responsibility to recover or divert metric tons of post consumer plastic packaging waste from to Sierra Leone High level engagement with policy makers and cutting edge diagnostics guided significant policy changes to reduce single use plastics Hotels and restaurants were encouraged to shift single use plastic packaging for shampoos and soaps to refillable dispensers The Micro Small and Medium Enterprise circular business mentorship program helped to expand markets to several local producers Brazil In IFC committed an eight year corporate loan of BRL million million to Orizon Meio Ambiente S A an environmental service provider to

Critical theory arose as a response to perceived inadequacies in Marxist theory and perceived changes in modern capitalism Critical theorists emphasized the ability of capitalism to shape the thought and experience of individuals it distorts how modern society and its products appear to us and how we think about them So aesthetic experience like all other experience is moulded to and compromised by capitalism For critical theory if we seek to understand aesthetics we need to acknowledge this distorting effect Critical theorists ask us to pay attention to how art and aesthetic experience suffer under capitalism and become part of the way in which capitalism prevents the formation of a better life They argue that art at all levels is succumbing to commodification which is to say is increasingly conforming to the demands of making profitable products rather than the demands of producing good art For critical theorists commodification brings with it standardization and external influence incompatible with genuine artistic achievement This concern applies both to popular culture and high culture although in different ways For critical theory aesthetics and art are thus part of the wrong state of things the world pervasively formed by instrumental reason reification and ideology As a result genuine art and aesthetic experience are increasingly being made less possible in capitalist society as are uncompromised thought and life more generally However critical theory also recommends art and aesthetic experience as part of the potential solution to this wrong state of things Artworks and aesthetic experiences can overturn the delusive effects of capitalism and disclose the genuine changeable nature of things Through formal rigour and imaginative openness art can expose contradictions suppressed phenomena and produce representations of alternative ways of living Art s liberating properties are thus aligned with formal experimentation As noted in the separate entry critical theory can be thought of narrowly or broadly Thought of broadly critical theory picks out philosophical work which combines a moral political conviction that human flourishing is presently blocked and a methodological conviction that interrogation of prevailing norms practices and concepts is necessary but perhaps insufficient to remove this blockage Thought of narrowly critical theory picks out a specific area of philosophy animated by these twin convictions the work of philosophers associated with the Frankfurt Institut f r Sozialforschung Institute for Social Research This group is often referred to as the Frankfurt School This entry will use critical theory in the narrow sense This entry will be further narrowed by focusing almost exclusively on the first generation of the Frankfurt School For economy I will use critical theory as shorthand for the more unwieldy first generation critical theory Closely related figures like Walter Benjamin and Ernst Bloch will not be collected under this phrase but explicitly picked out as and when they are relevant The Frankfurt School is often spoken of as having three generations Core figures in the first generation include Max Horkheimer Theodor Adorno and Herbert Marcuse Horkheimer who would become a close collaborator with Adorno took directorship of the Institute in The Institute was closed by the Nazis in Horkheimer was instrumental in relocating and re starting the Institute eventually settling in America in Adorno and Marcuse followed The most famous of their works would be Dialectic of Enlightenment Adorno Horkheimer One Dimensional Man Marcuse and Negative Dialectics Adorno As important as this American context and exposure to American popular culture would be to their aesthetics so too was the German cultural milieu of the s and s For example before joining the Institute Adorno had studied musical composition with the atonal composer Alban Berg later commemorated in Adorno s Alban Berg Master of the Smallest Link befriended philosopher and critic Siegfried Kracauer and written musical criticism for the journal Musikbl tter des Anbruch Claussen Walter Benjamin s ideas were broadly disseminated via his friendship with Adorno for more on their relationship including with respect to aesthetics see Rosen Buck Morss Nicholsen b The ideas of Georg Luk cs and Ernst Bloch were also influential on the first generation critical theorists as we will see The second and third generations of critical theory are roughly marked by the coming to prominence of J rgen Habermas and Axel Honneth respectively The three generations are not merely distinguished by their personnel There are important theoretical differences The Cambridge Habermas Lexicon begins its Aesthetics entry Duvenage with the statement that Whereas aesthetics plays an important role among the thinkers of the first generation this is not so for Habermas For an opposing view of Habermas relationship to aesthetics however see Duvenage McMahon Mackin Honneth seldom mentions aesthetics though see Honneth While there are valuable remarks on aesthetics in the work of both then they do not obviously belong in a discussion of the characteristic shape of the interface between critical theory and aesthetics Critical theory s distinctive treatment of aesthetics is thus confined largely to the first generation In s Traditional and Critical Theory Horkheimer offers the following statement about the programme he and his colleagues pursue and its moral urgency It is not surprising that this approach produced books with titles like Eclipse of Reason Horkheimer One Dimensional Man Marcuse or Prophets of Deceit Lowenthal Guterman But the emergence of books with titles like Aesthetic Theory Adorno or The Aesthetic Dimension Marcuse is perhaps harder to anticipate Given the nature of critical theory and its urgent pursuit of concrete improvement in people s material and social lives one might wonder why critical theory has an aesthetics at all One answer is that critical theory has no need for an aesthetics Its practitioners simply happened to like to think about art and did so It is certainly true that many of the members of the first generation had biographical connections to or a pre established interest in the world of art But critical theory has an aesthetics for theoretical not biographical reasons To make these reasons clear we need to take a detour through the work of Karl Marx and then Georg Luk cs Critical theory is grounded in a very particular approach to Marx which emphasizes capitalism s power to determine the world of individual thought and experience see Kautzer This approach rests on a keen interest in commodity fetishism a phenomenon which Marx discusses relatively briefly in volume one of Capital For Marx commodity fetishism is an effect produced by the objective structure of social exchange The buying and selling of goods draws equivalences between the goods exchanged But this equivalence is performed not by comparing the labour time expended on those goods but by comparing what appear to be properties of the commodities themselves Price indices are driven by social facts about exchange and production but these social facts vanish from view and the prices themselves appear to be properties of objects This gold bar is worth and thus equivalent in value to coats bricks and so on not The socially necessary labour time involved in gold mining is such that a gold bar s exchange value is expressed as Capitalism thus presents itself as natural This conceals the fact that exchange value arises not from the nature of things but rather from the way we organize our labour In turn this conceals the fact that the way we organize our labour is not natural but in fact open to change On Marx s account commodity fetishism affects the way in which we experience and therefore theorize about the social world It conceals the true nature of capitalism This concealment can be understood as something like an optical illusion Marx uses the instructive analogy of the appearance of air While the appearance of air or of commodities is not altered by our coming into scientific knowledge of their true constitution the fact remains that we can and have acquired this knowledge in spite of that appearance Thus for Marx all that is needed to see through commodity fetishism is to employ reason to enquire into what lies beneath the apparent nature of capitalism Luk cs most influential work History and Class Consciousness extends and revises Marx s analysis of commodity fetishism Unlike Marx Luk cs does not see capitalism as merely presenting a misleading appearance as an optical illusion might but exerting an effect on our very way of thinking and perceiving altogether as a hallucination or delusion might Accordingly Luk cs held commodity fetishism to have a systemic and general influence on consciousness He used the term Verdinglichung or reification to name the broader effects he saw as stemming from commodity fetishism Reification covers not only thought about or adjacent to the economy but thought in general The richness and unpredictability of the world is glossed over by a form of thought which presumes complete agreement between abstract concepts and particular things And this narrowing of thought is replicated in a narrowing of experience Reification as a form of thought is grounded in and enforced by a broader tendency towards standardization which capitalism carries with it from commodification the increasing tendency to convert goods into products produced for exchange in line with the demands of the market to bureaucratization the administration of the social world according to inflexible rules and so on The claim then is that under capitalism we come to conceive of and experience the world in terms of general categories This is a problem because these general categories are it is claimed overly restrictive The world has properties causal moral and functional which are not captured by these categories and hence are excluded from reified thought and reified experience Facts which might undermine the present social order the exploitation integral to capitalist production for example are excluded from thought and experience This also has moral implications General moral and political categories like citizen human worker and so on will tend towards excluding persons who do not conform to the restrictive standards these categories come with The idea of reification if we hope to overcome it or indeed to explain our ability to perceive it requires us to posit some counter reifying force For Luk cs it is the proletariat working class that are potentially this force The proletariat need only realize the exploitative nature of capitalist production and recognize that they have the power to change this process The proletariat are necessarily always on the brink of this realization in Luk cs view as their working conditions are intrinsically counter reifying They themselves are the contingent human labour which is concealed by the apparently natural and necessary world of capitalism and commodities While Luk cs account of reification exerted great influence on the Frankfurt School see Feenberg Kavoulakos the proletarian strand of his thought did not Returning to Horkheimer s seminal Traditional and Critical Theory we find the following remark This leaves critical theory in a difficult position If reification is total and counter reifying forces are totally absent then Horkheimer s claim to be thinking in service of those oppressed by capitalism is incoherent Critical theory requires a counter reifying force to explain how it can perceive and see beyond the epistemic errors produced by reification For Marx commodity fetishism was a problem with the comprehension of labour which could be solved either through reading more accurate literature about labour hence the writing of Capital or better acquainting oneself with the reality of the production process hence Marx s ability to write Capital Luk cs appears to identify revolutionary proletarian consciousness as the means to undo the effects of reification although the mechanics of its formation are not entirely clear For critical theory by contrast commodity fetishism and reification are not problems which can be overcome by modifying either the content of experience by reading Capital say or the social position of the experiencer One can learn as much as possible about the conditions of the working class and be as close to the production process as one likes but reification will still obtain For critical theory reification is a problem with the very form of experience itself and the solution to reification will come through processes which can engage and manipulate that form of experience Thus for critical theory reification is an aesthetic problem in its original and broadest sense as concerned with the realm of sensible experience Critical theory s task will be to find avenues which can disrupt the influence of reification and make the genuine state of things and the genuine possibilities for change open to thought and experience Several avenues for producing this effect were explored but chief among them was art and aesthetic experience Luk cs whose early work had been so influential on Critical theory later became much closer to Soviet orthodoxy even to the extent that he repudiated his earlier work on reification He also broke with his earlier equally influential work on aesthetics like s Soul and Form Here too Luk cs moved into closer alignment with Soviet thought The Soviet art movement known as Socialist realism explicitly thematized concrete social and political factors in art in order to instil a correct understanding of them in the art appreciator Luk cs was not uncritical of the actual implementation of this movement especially under Stalin Luk cs b and nor does he deny the quality and power of the critical realists who likewise include concrete historical detail but without explicit socialist ideology Luk cs b chapters and But above all it is realism in opposition to the decadent formalism Luk cs b of modernism that Luk cs urged as best serving the moral and political aims of Marxism Adorno Marcuse and Benjamin by contrast found their favourite examples of the liberating power of art in multiple schools and time periods including modernism nearly all of which refused any overt political content They also openly questioned the efficacy and quality of much political art see e g Marcuse Schoolman Klassen Blumenfeld Adorno a b This rejection was seen by many including the later Luk cs as evidence of elitism political disengagement and immoral indifference to the world at large see Zuidervaart for an overview However critical theory s rejection of politically engaged art is not driven by disagreement with the politics of such artworks Rather it stems from an apparently apolitical disagreement about the necessary and appropriate relationship between content and form critical theory generally emphasizes the primacy of form in explaining both art s achievement and its counter reifying effects see Hartle for an overview of the development of this position The demands of such formal success are it is claimed incompatible with direct political engagement To clarify this we need to look more closely at what form and content mean in this context For critical theory aesthetic value is reducible neither to form nor content A complex relationship between the two is at the core of critical theory s aesthetics It is claimed that form and content are inextricable and mutually informing But here again we should not confuse this with more familiar positions The claim is not that form and content are identical as in A C Bradley s infamous claim in s Oxford Lectures on Poetry or Cleanth Brooks Heresy of Paraphrase Rather the claim most often advanced is that content is converted into or sedimented into form while still not becoming identical with it This idea requires further explanation When Marcuse and Adorno claim that content is converted into form within art they are best understood not as advancing the claim that the surface themes and content of the artwork are rendered formal but as claiming that the meaning of the artwork is expressed primarily by the formal properties of the artwork For example while Kafka s The Trial has as its surface content a story about a man who is subjected to an interminable and senseless trial for an unknown crime its true meaning according to Adorno is an expression of certain features of capitalism see further O Connor This expression of its deeper meaning is achieved through the texture and organization of the novel itself rather than in its apparent themes Nowhere does The Trial baldly state that capitalism has produced an absurd and inhuman form of life Nor importantly is it necessary that Kafka believed such a thing Critical theory s claim is that the truth of life under capitalism is in some way communicated to the form of artworks directly Some problems with this view are presented in section To see why content must be converted into form in this way for art to be successful and why this seemingly abstruse issue prevents critical theorists from endorsing expressly political art we need to look once more at reification The theory of reification claims that thought has taken on a characteristically abstract and instrumental character It is this form of thought which ultimately underlies the persistence and dangers of capitalism Anything which can be assimilated by this form of thought is rendered exchangeable and serves as evidence of the appropriateness of that form of thought itself This means that moral or political claims in art can themselves become part of their commodity value and fail to disrupt the form of thought which caused the moral or political injuries that motivated the art itself The dissenting novel music or film is something which for all its sincerity is still offered alongside all the others and whose mode of delivery and consumption replicates and vindicates the very form of exchange and hence consciousness it seeks to undermine If art is able to show a form of life and thought outside of capitalism then it must resist absorption by the characteristic structure of capitalism Via Marx critical theorists see the characteristic structure of capitalism as commodity exchange Commodity exchange has the characteristic function of rendering objects perfectly exchangeable by assigning them monetary value Via Luk cs critical theorists see commodity exchange also having a characteristic reified kind of experience and thought that which sees objects as all conforming to general laws concepts and types From this we see that successful art must resist being easily turned into a generic commodity and must also resist being formed by and wholly comprehensible through pre set types In art s case these pre set types would include compositional conventions cliches platitudes and the like These are structural reasons why art must resist easy adoption by the market and in turn audiences It must also resist easy adoption to avoid contradicting its own meaning If art is aimed against exchangeability and clich then it must also be aimed against having its content easily converted into products and clich s This is why form is primary in understanding art s ability to undo the effects of reification It is only through the problematization of the relationship between form and content and art and its consumption that the meaning of an artwork can be protected from commodification and nullification Art is obliged to ceaselessly formally innovate and to ceaselessly reject pre set established compositional norms In this way art s meaning its critical relationship to capitalism is communicated in its form and not in its explicit subject matter Artworks avoid baldly stating claims about the inhumanity of contemporary society these could become slogans be resold and defused and instead show it through their challenging formal organization How exactly this critical content becomes converted into formal properties is not clear Nor is it clear how broad social problems come to be encapsulated in specific artworks authored by specific artists This is a problem which critical theory never fully mastered In Adorno s work there is no suggestion that this formalization of content is a product of the artist s conscious or subconscious intention Rather the process is blind and the social content enters the artwork and creative process not as thematic content but as formal problems with which the artist is faced see Hulatt a Marcuse for his part likewise emphasizes the migration of social content into form and notes that it is a central perplexity in Marxist aesthetics In a move which mirrors Adorno s attempt to see social problems as translated into artistic problems Marcuse explains this migration partly in terms of the social preformation of the meaning of artistic materials The very stuff out of which art is made word colour tone carries socially encoded meanings expectations and conventions This limitation of aesthetic autonomy he writes is the condition under which art can become a social factor Unlike Adorno however Marcuse also sees art as a repository of transhistorical truths and features These relate both to certain core definitional features of art and aesthetic response Marcuse and to core features of the transhistorical species being he sees as underlying human experience Marcuse Marcuse introduces these non historicist elements in order to rule out a reductive Marxist account which would claim that art s function quality and meaning is chained to its society and class position Marcuse holds that aesthetic properties cannot be so reducible as this would render our appreciation of artworks across epochs and economic systems inexplicable Further it would nullify art s important ability to speak beyond and outstrip contemporary ideals and norms While for Adorno art s relationship to its social content was thoroughly hostile both in its defiance of contemporary norms and its demonstration of the revisability of those norms Marcuse offers a more variegated picture Art critically engages with and negates society but also describes unrealized potentials for improvement see e g Marcuse This difference between the two thinkers will be discussed further in section Adorno and Horkheimer coined the phrase Culture Industry in their jointly authored book Dialectic of Enlightenment It was intended ironically as an insulting oxymoron This irony has been overtaken by history The music and film spheres for example proudly refer to themselves as industries This outcome illustrates after a fashion the thesis and limits of critical theory s critique of popular culture To critical theory culture is in a process of coming to an end This coming to an end is precipitated by ever increasing strength of norms of exchange and standardization industry in controlling the production of art culture see further Hulatt b This thesis is developed in part sociologically through examination of the mechanics of radio transmission the nascent Hollywood system the distribution and sale of records and so on Empirical research into this claim was pursued in various ways including the Princeton Radio Research Project at which Adorno worked once he arrived in America see further Jenemann The thesis was also developed through aesthetic analysis of popular culture itself Critical theory found Western popular artforms wanting judging whole genres and media devoid of merit Adorno s criticisms of specific popular artworks were often mordant and unsympathetic and have had an outsize effect on perception of critical theory s stance towards popular culture It can appear that critical theory simply rejects popular culture as inferior and seeks a return to the kind of high culture many critical theorists enjoyed in fin de siecle Germany Such snobbery would appear particularly odd in supposedly radical Marxist philosophy However the broader account of popular culture its superiority to high culture in some respects and the tragedy of its unrealized technical potential is innovative and often overlooked In a letter to Benjamin Adorno remarks that popular and high art are two torn halves which do not add up to a whole Adorno c This remark conveys a number of things which must be borne in mind The existence of two separate spheres of popular culture and high art is a reflection of the wrong state of things their opposition and polarization would not be part of a good society Both popular culture and high art have capacities and deficiencies which the other lacks indeed they each form a mirror image of the other However these two spheres of culture cannot be re unified by sheer force of will they do not add up to a unified whole because they have been objectively driven apart by the nature of the social whole Marcuse takes a similar view We see then that Adorno does not see popular culture as merely coarse product It in fact preserves properties key to art and serves as a rebuke to high culture For example popular music is pleasant to listen to and more or less immediately accessible This kind of accessibility and pleasure is part of what ideal art would be and it is part of the failure of modern art that it has been forced to lose both its accessibility and its beauty We will enter into the reasons why it suffers this loss momentarily Adorno is also not blind to the economic injustices which govern the world of high art the leisure time and disposable income necessary to acquire a taste in classical music for example Conversely classical music has the virtue that it delivers on what it promises genuine novelty pure aesthetic satisfaction and formal achievement By contrast popular music promises novelty ungoverned satisfaction of impulses and perhaps some associated lifestyle but is forced to repeatedly renege on these promises see for example Adorno s discussion of syncopation in Jazz in Lewandowski One way of putting Adorno s point is that popular culture is not objectionable because it stimulates the passions but because it does not truly satisfy them Rebentisch Trautmann This criticism is shared by Marcuse who sees increasingly permissive popular culture not as objectionable because it is permissive he is in favour of relaxed sexual mores for instance but because it never delivers on its promise For Marcuse the release of emotions in cultural products be they sexual longing political frustration or repressed aggression is allowed just enough to ensure the popularity of the product and not explored in its full transformative power This idea of reneging on promises also underwrites Adorno s criticism of movements to popularize high culture For example Adorno deeply objected to the transmission of performances of Beethoven over the radio This was not because Beethoven was too good for the public but because the technology involved was not good enough for the public The genuine experience of a live performance was being replaced by a low resolution transmission and the public were invited to believe they had received the genuine article Or so Adorno claims Adorno This thread runs through critical theory s treatment of popular culture not a suspicion of popularity accessibility or pleasurability but a suspicion of the failure to genuinely provide these things Popular music and cinema promise excitement and novelty but in fact work according to pre set schema Popular media promises to bring excitement of high culture into the home but in fact the transmission is poor and incapable of properly conveying what you wish to listen to This is the mirror image of high culture s failure Quoting Brecht Adorno notes that culture s mansion is built out of dogshit Adorno By this he means that high culture is dependent on a society whose inequality and inhumanity makes the better form of life high art outlines ever more impossible For more on the role of Brecht in Adorno s thought see Rothe Under capitalism both high culture and popular culture are not good enough for the public not vice versa In section the counter reifying force of art was explained negatively The unusual formal organization of artworks serves to protect their content from being nullified by the effects of commodification and reification But the position is not simply that the artwork conceals its meaning such that it cannot be easily commodified It is that the meaning of the artwork in some fashion breaks with and undermines the false consciousness it has been protected against Art is thus not merely defensively organized but aggressively organized also It does not merely elude reification but actively combats it This claim is one of the more vexed and complex elements of critical theory s aesthetics To anticipate it will be the subject s experience of the artwork which is held to have this aggressive counter reifying effect That experience will be elicited by the appreciator s active participation in attending to the form content organization of the artwork The counter reifying effect of art appears to be socio historically specific it can be lost over time and critical the artwork appears to indict and overturn certain pathologies of thought and social organization In this section we will look more closely at how various critical theorists explain this view We can find one source of this idea in the work of a contemporary Ernst Bloch who had a marked influence on the Frankfurt School Bloch saw art as combining a faithful account of both the current state of things and of possibilities usually ignored This is the not yet which Bloch saw as concealed by conventional experience but forcibly disclosed by the successful artwork as well as other cultural products see Kellner and O Hara The utopian aspect to the artwork its representation of another form of life is in some sense fantastical and imaginary It is not a depiction of how things are but a depiction of how they genuinely might be But in this way art discloses the close proximity of another way of ordering life and the malleability of that which appeared as necessary and natural see Moir Levitas As with Adorno and Marcuse Bloch apparently paradoxically combines a keen attention to the formal constitution of the artwork and its autonomy Bloch with a commitment to the claim that social conditions enter into the artwork Bloch Crucially it is the combination of the autonomous processes of art and the participation of the appreciator which yields up a disruptive experience Bloch This disruption within the aesthetic experience serves to point beyond the integration of the artwork s form and its material and via the relationship between the artwork and the social content it integrates it likewise points beyond the established social order Bloch This is the utopian moment integral to great art for Bloch In Spirit of Utopia Bloch largely develops this thought through analysis of music but in later works like Principle of Hope Bloch the same approach is recapitulated and applied not only to the various artistic media but other cultural areas also see Bloch This core vision of the artwork as eliciting in aesthetic experience a changed outlook on a reified society is inherited by both Adorno and Marcuse But both revise Bloch s approach in differing ways For Adorno art does not directly show the world as it really is but makes plain the contradictions and distortions internal to reified consciousness itself Rather than disclosing new potentials for action and change art instead discloses the full estrangement between reified consciousness and the world In other words genuine aesthetic experience is a process of disillusionment Our reified consciousness perceives no obvious difference between the world as we take it to be and the world as it is But art forcibly discloses this difference The art appreciator comes to learn the depth and extent of their ignorance and the urgency of breaking with the dominant form of thought The utopianism of Bloch reappears in a more muted form art gives us awareness that the demands and tendencies of capitalist society are not absolute but could in principle change Adorno s caveat is that we do not know how or in what direction this change should be effected This is due to the broader ethical dislocation produced by modern society For differing takes on Adorno s negative ethics see Finlayson Freyenhagen Bernstein a transcribed discussion between Adorno and Bloch on the nature of utopian thinking provides useful further detail in Bloch The way in which art demonstrates the disconnection between reified thought and the world is highly complex We can say that for Adorno art engages the conceptual structure of thought and experience and guides it such that this structure is lead to collapse in the course of its being applied This is a power it shares with philosophy with the key difference that philosophy achieves this explicitly through manipulation of and argument about concepts in the course of their application in thought and art accomplishes it through the manipulation of aesthetic material To answer how the hermetically sealed artwork is able to do this we would need to spell out Adorno s claim that extra aesthetic content is sedimented into formal aesthetic problematics in individual artworks This is beyond the scope of the present entry but see Hulatt a Nicholsen a Paddison Sherratt Marcuse sees artworks as having a liberating potential and as disclosing to us possibilities for change Art discloses these possibilities in both a destructive and creative way It is destructive in that it serves as an indictment of certain governing forms of thought and experience But it is also creative art serves to re present the genuine state of things and thus uncovers the objective potentials for liberation which are concealed there Marcuse Marcuse s work can thus be understood as an amalgam of some of the formal sophistication of Adorno s aesthetics with the utopian emphasis of Bloch s account For Bloch and Adorno engagement with the artwork leads in radically differing directions For Adorno aesthetic experience does not point towards a better future nor show any signs of such a future in the present It rather shows the inhumanity of the present This is the indictment Marcuse likewise finds in art For Bloch by contrast aesthetic experience presents an account of the genuine state of things which includes already existing anticipations of a better form of life These anticipations provide the intelligible if incomplete link between the present and the utopia that could emerge from it These Marcuse often refers to as moments of liberation It may seem that the two points from Bloch and Adorno are in tension and thus that Marcuse is ill advised to try to combine them However Marcuse introduces a third theoretic element which resolves the apparent tension the work of Sigmund Freud The rational critical element of Marcuse s account conforms significantly to Adorno s approach but the utopianism of Bloch is recast in a psychoanalytic register Marcuse understands the utopian function of art to be discharged by its ability to facilitate desublimation the expression of repressed urges This should not be confused with catharsis Catharsis in which emotions are activated and then purged leaves the subject pacified free of the troublesome energies that were activated This pacifying effect of catharsis in art is criticized by Marcuse and desublimation is held to avoid it For Marcuse desublimation is an expression of repressed emotions urges and potentialities of which the appreciator was unaware On learning of their existence the appreciator is made aware of repressed potentialities of man and nature and is granted an emancipation of sensibility which points towards the form of life and of sensibility which revolution would bring about Marcuse see further This is continuous with Marcuse s broader political program for which a better world would not only entail re organization of the structure of society but also of the psychological structure that society imposes on individuals see Kellner Marcuse For Marcuse then the aesthetic experience is both critical and rationally ordered and an arena for the liberation of drives emotions and potentials These respectively articulate the contradictions and intolerability of the present and unharness the libidinal resources which could realize the potential for a better future In the th century philosophers anglophone and non anglophone largely shifted away from discussing the aesthetics of nature The Frankfurt School were a marked exception to this tendency In their emphasis on the moral and aesthetic significance of nature s beauty critical theorists anticipate many features of contemporary work in environmental aesthetics Like environmental aestheticians critical theorists understand our appreciation of nature s beauty to be morally significant They also likewise see aesthetic appreciation of nature to be bound up with the recognition of and resistance to humanity s destruction and exploitation of nature Critical theorists differ sharply from contemporary environmental aestheticians however in their account of what carries this moral significance It is not nature in itself without human interference that is of prime importance Any idea of nature being ahistorically beautiful in itself is rejected It is nature in relation to our current human capacities needs and projects which carries both beauty and a moral impetus to relate to nature in a less damaging fashion This section will touch briefly on some of the distinctive features of their work on this theme Adorno Horkheimer and Marcuse consistently problematized the distinction between nature and history They did not claim that nature as picked out by the physical sciences was historically relative They rather claimed that the concept and experience of nature as a realm of facts and values outside of human control was historically determined in its content and means of application When Adorno and Horkheimer claim that what is natural is historical they are interested in normative conceptions of nature which are used either to make the contingent appear necessary capitalism simply follows human nature or to advocate for inhumane treatment of persons Likewise they propose that nature as experienced is influenced by these historical factors Adorno s complex account of nature is developed in its various strands in Cook Vogel Flodin Natural beauty in both its scope what counts as natural and quality those aesthetic properties which can attach in virtue of an object s being natural is seen as a historical phenomenon Hammer This further means that natural beauty stands under the threat of clich ideological misuse and co optation just as artworks do Simply the aesthetic properties of nature shift across time and what is thus appropriate in judging natural beauty likewise develops over time Daniels Any well developed aesthetics of nature includes not only a criterion of appropriate judgement but also a criterion of the appropriate objects of judgement Trivially aesthetic judgements of nature cannot be well formed when aimed at an object which is the product of and perceived under the description of complete artificiality Conventionally the meaningful debate to be had is over what degree if any objects produced by artifice are appropriate objects of the appreciation of natural beauty Critical theory adds a unique complication to this debate It denies that the merely natural is an appropriate object for aesthetic experience Johnson We will explore this in the next section Critical theory sets a high store on the aesthetic experience of nature but not on the experience of mere nature This is made particularly stark in Aesthetic Theory where Adorno compares raw nature with industrial materials This rejection of an aesthetics of nature in the raw is combined with a keen interest in natural beauty This appears paradoxical but can be elucidated through comparison with contemporary environmental aesthetics For environmental aesthetics mere nature is indeed an appropriate object of aesthetic attention see e g Budd Saito The properties of mere nature as opposed to artworks are held to undermine some traditional dichotomies For example Ronald Hepburn influentially observed that nature needs to be framelessly appreciated as an enclosing space The usual strict separation between an art object and its environs is not present as nature is both the immediate object of interest a copse of trees for example and the enclosure continuous with the object the vista in which the copse is situated Separately it has been claimed that appropriate aesthetic appreciation of nature benefits from or requires theoretical understanding of nature itself and its structure for examples of such scientific cognitivism see Carlson Eaton Parsons Such scientifically grounded appreciation of nature is held to be objective appreciation of nature as what it is Critical theory s rejection of mere nature can be seen as stemming from a similar desire to appreciate nature as what it is and a similar conviction that doing so will dissolve the oppositions and dichotomies familiar from art But critical theory urges us to further dissolve the dichotomy between nature and human artifice itself Adorno Horkheimer and Marcuse see nature and humanity as not separate but continuous for an overview of this and its relation to Luk cs and Marx see Feenberg And so proper contemplation of nature as it is is of nature for us as parts of that nature Mere nature is nature which stands opposed to us and which we are approaching as if it were radically different to us rather than a fellow piece of nature This is why Adorno sees untamed nature as resembling unrefined industrial material in both cases the merely natural the industrial byproduct we have objects which appear to stand opposed to human need and present as hostile to us This is what stands behind remarks by both Adorno and Marcuse to the effect that both humanity and nature are not fully realized Nature by itself for Adorno and Marcuse is unreconciled and hostile towards humans who are themselves part of nature For nature s own benefit a different kind of relationship between humans and nature is required And natural beauty is held to point towards it Krebber It is common to find in environmental aesthetics an admission that the area of enquiry is bound up either with moral intuitions about nature s value or in some way importantly tied to a broader moral project of environmental conservation and transformation e g Saito Saito Carlson Alcaraz Le n Carlson Lintott Here again Adorno and Marcuse can be understood as sharing this feature and transforming it Their environmental aesthetics is not embedded in care for nature without humans but for nature for humans and correlatively humans for nature Adorno and Marcuse embed aesthetic response to nature into a broader project of reconceiving and reorienting the relationship between humanity and nature Following on from a myriad of influences some anthropological chiefly Henri Hubert and Marcel Mauss James George Frazer and Roger Caillois e g and some philosophical critical theory understands the relationship between humanity and nature to have been predominantly dominating just as humanity s relationship to itself has been dominating and oppressive Similarly just as aesthetic experience offers a vision of a different order of social being so too does aesthetic experience of nature offer a vision of a reconciled relationship between human agency and nature Mere nature then is ineligible to produce such an insight as mere nature is outside of and opposed to a relationship with humanity This leads Adorno to find images of reconciliation in paradoxically images of bygone eras of the exploitation of nature Here Adorno intersects with the rich aesthetic traditions of both the picturesque and the ruin but brings a very different sensibility to these phenomena In Aesthetic Theory he writes What grounds Adorno s positive aesthetic evaluation here is the image of a relationship between nature and humanity which from our timeframe appears more pacified Given the environmentally disastrous logic of modern society the images of a reconciled utopian relationship to nature can be found only retrospectively in the image of the less bad relationships to nature which have now passed away We can pick out four features of critical theory s distinctive treatment of aesthetics The first of these is a product of critical theory s general methodology at that time First generation critical theory largely holds that any object of experience or theory is a part in and reflective of a social totality of facts and processes see further Jay The form and depth of this reflection varies but the general view is that any element of this totality could be determined by and inform us about any other This warrants speculative kinds of philosophical interpretation in which facts apparently limited to one sphere of logic or psychology say are in fact determined by and reflective of apparently disconnected spheres of economic exchange or social institutions say Art is no exception to this approach Both works of high art and ephemeral pieces of pop culture can have philosophical social and political content as parts of their objective constitution Secondly this emphasis on the philosophical richness of art is combined with a primary interest in aesthetic form In turn this amalgam is wedded to a conviction that aesthetic experience despite being formally rigorous and content laden can offer a form of insight unavailable through conventional conceptual reasoning This insight precisely by being a break with the kind of experience moulded to the wrong state of things is held to have emancipatory promise Thirdly the tensions and instabilities between these jointly held aesthetic methodologies are not accidental but intentional Critical theory refuses to attempt to deliver static definitions but also refuses to do without such definitions It is neither rationalized nor irrational Art really does have general features but successful artworks always both engage and destabilize general concepts There is an emphasis on the necessity of using concepts to understand art and on the ability of artworks to ultimately elude conceptual capture This complex approach which is incapable of delivering a closed definition of art or aesthetic value is intended to prioritize fidelity to aesthetic experience over dogmatic conceptual structures Fourthly and following from the preceding three features there is the seemingly paradoxical conviction that artworks are political and practical via their very refusal of explicit politics and practicality It is artworks of surpassing quality attended to for their own sake that have a liberating potential Critical theory tends to assume and sometimes explicitly argue that artists who primarily pursue a non artistic goal in their art political or otherwise cannot realize this level of quality and art appreciators who seek a pay off in art political or otherwise cannot properly attend to the value of artworks These four features all reach their most extreme expression in the work of Theodor Adorno But they are also pursued at differing levels of extremity and emphasis in other critical theorists and thinkers associated with them most obviously Marcuse Benjamin and Bloch For critical theorists there is a balance to be struck between analysing art and hence articulating it in conceptual terms and making clear the importance of the artwork s ability to outstrip concepts altogether The preceding has been an account of the ways in which critical theory has explored and handled this demanding balancing act and the broader theoretic considerations which together with the artworks investigated entered into that balance Please

and sustainability The document s tone is pragmatic and forward looking emphasizing resilience and long term coordination rather than speed For those of us observing from within Asia this plan s recommendations define the regional space in which Indonesia and its neighbors will pursue their own modernization paths The plan s recommendations identify three main priorities that focus on strengthening technological capacity deepening the domestic market and aligning development with security By per capita GDP is projected to reach the level of middle income developed economies personal income growth will match productivity and the middle income group is expected to surpass million people These targets link prosperity with social stability suggesting that economic expansion is no longer about speed alone but about balance and fairness Innovation stands at the core of this vision China is widely expected to raise research and development to about percent of GDP by compared with percent in One fifth of this will be dedicated to basic sciences Strategic attention is directed to semiconductors artificial intelligence quantum computing hydrogen energy and advanced materials The goal is to create what policymakers call new quality productive forces connecting technology education and human talent into a single system This orientation resonates across the region Research partnerships transparent standards and skilling programs can transform technology exchange into shared innovation rather than dependence As Indonesia invests in vocational and research capacity cooperation in renewable energy biotechnology and digital governance will shape the quality of its growth Environmental transformation forms the second foundation Investment in new energy vehicles battery storage and green manufacturing will expand supported by stronger environmental regulations This shift toward a green economy has significance beyond China s borders Southeast Asian economies from Indonesia to Vietnam are pursuing similar transitions toward cleaner energy and sustainable industrial growth Collaborative projects in green manufacturing low carbon logistics and energy storage could transform these national efforts into a regional movement where climate action and economic opportunity reinforce each other The plan recommendations also expand the concept of Digital China It envisions greater computing power a secure data infrastructure and the integration of digital systems into the real economy Global digital trade already exceeds trillion annually and is expected to grow rapidly through artificial intelligence cloud computing and smart logistics Such expansion will redefine supply chains and commerce across Asia In Indonesia the rise of the digital economy reflects the same dynamic Cooperation in cybersecurity e commerce governance and data regulation will help ensure that interdependence enhances national resilience rather than limits it Domestic reform remains at the heart of the plan recommendations resilience logic Expanding household consumption stimulating private investment and building a unified national market are expected to create a self sustaining cycle of supply and demand Internal circulation is not isolation but a reinforcement of external openness A stable Chinese market will generate consistent demand for regional exports while supporting cross border industrial cooperation Indonesia s downstream industries Vietnam s electronics sector and Thailand s bio circular economy can all integrate into this evolving regional production structure The Belt and Road Initiative illustrates this new phase of pragmatic cooperation The initiative is being refined around the principle of high quality development Projects are designed with greater transparency financial sustainability and environmental accountability The Jakarta Bandung high speed rail is a visible success but the deeper transformation lies in the emerging collaboration on digital infrastructure renewable energy and health systems Financial innovation supports this shift The plan recommendations promote green and inclusive finance as well as blended investment mechanisms such as green bonds to mobilize long term capital for sustainable projects Aligning regulatory standards and credit assessment across Asia can turn cooperation into tangible investment pipelines that advance shared growth Human capability connects all these ambitions The plan recommendations link education research and industry through innovation clusters and vocational programs Collaboration among universities think tanks and companies will prepare the workforce for emerging industries Joint scholarships apprenticeships and policy changes can help align skills with new economic realities For Indonesia and the region building human capital is central to ensuring that modernization is equitable A generation equipped with critical thinking and technical competence will sustain development more effectively than any policy instrument Security as defined in the plan recommendations extends beyond defense It covers food energy finance and supply chain stability as part of a broader concept of national resilience China s dual circulation strategy balances domestic strength with global openness to prevent systemic shocks This notion resonates with many in Asia who see security as cooperation rather than confrontation As the global environment grows more volatile regional resilience will depend on collective stability and mutual confidence What emerges from the plan recommendations is not a blueprint for dominance but a framework for coexistence Modernization is seen as an evolving conversation between different systems seeking equilibrium Southeast Asia is not an audience to this process but a participant shaping its outcome With its demographic vitality pragmatic diplomacy and creative industries the region contributes to a shared geography of progress Indonesia s leadership is crucial in this respect As a democracy and maritime hub the country can guide regional cooperation toward transparency accountability and mutual benefit By strengthening governance capacity research networks and industrial collaboration Indonesia can ensure that engagement with China contributes to resilience rather than dependency In its next five year plan if China achieves its benchmarks of research and development above percent of GDP carbon peaking before and expansion of the middle income group it presents a disciplined model of modernization It shows that State planning and market vitality can reinforce each other when guided by a long term vision For the rest of Asia this is both an opportunity and a challenge It calls for regional cooperation grounded in trust and informed by local priorities Development in this sense becomes a collective act rather than a competition between models If cooperation is guided by openness accountability and shared innovation modernization can become a common enterprise that strengthens both national and regional confidence In the coming years Indonesia and its neighbors will need to navigate this landscape with clarity and principle The future of Asia s growth will depend not only on investment and technology but on the moral and institutional choices we make China s th Five Year Plan recommendations offer a reminder that progress is sustainable only when it enhances trust widens opportunities and deepens cooperation That is the essence of shared modernization in a region where prosperity and stability must grow together The author is the executive director of PARA Syndicate a Jakarta based independent think tank The views don t necessarily reflect those of China Daily

Community and Local Development CLD is a set of approaches to development that emphasize community and local control over planning decisions and investment resources empowering communities to identify and advance their development priorities Experience has shown that when given clear and transparent rules access to information and appropriate technical and financial support communities can effectively organize to identify community priorities and address local development challenges by working in partnership with local governments and other institutions to build small scale infrastructure deliver basic services and enhance livelihoods opportunities The World Bank recognizes that CLD approaches and actions are important elements of an effective poverty reduction and sustainable development strategy In many countries CLD operations are the only mechanism available to reach remote and vulnerable groups in a timely credible and responsive manner In addition they have a strong track record in moving funds quickly and flexibly in response to natural disasters such as typhoons or earthquakes as well as to other crises such as the COVID pandemic For instance as a complement to household cash transfers community level block grants that are based on community emergency plans can be distributed to rural villages and urban neighborhoods to help communities quickly and effectively adapt to a shock since community groups often know best what the specific needs are in each community The Bank supports governments in designing implementing and evaluating CLD programs across a range of low to middle income countries including countries affected by fragility conflict and violence FCV The programs respond to a variety of urgent needs including access to clean water rural roads school and health clinic construction nutrition programs for mothers and infants and support for micro enterprises These programs have consistently shown an ability to deliver an increase in access to quality infrastructure and services in a cost effective manner and in ways that enjoy broad community support and local legitimacy Last Updated Oct Over the past decades many national governments have used CLD approaches as a way to combat poverty and reduce inequality The approach of partnering with communities and local units of government including putting resources under the direct control of community groups has led to the efficient and inclusive delivery of basic services and when sustained over time measurable reductions in poverty particularly among the poorest populations and communities As of June the World Bank supported active CLD projects in countries valued at US billion Of this approximately US billion is Bank financing percent of which is IDA or IDA blend financing with an additional US billion provided by borrowers and other donors CLD approaches remain particularly important in situations of FCV where they can enable capacity constrained governments to deliver at scale As of end June the global active CLD FCV portfolio covered of the countries percent on the FY List of Fragile and Conflict Affected Situations as well as other countries which were either on earlier harmonized lists of fragile situations when projects began or are countries where projects are targeted at the displaced or conflict zones CLD programs have evolved over time to adapt to many different local contexts and needs delivering tangible results on the ground in some of the most geographically remote and operationally hard to reach areas on the globe Moving forward the World Bank is leveraging the opportunities that CLD approaches and platforms offer including delivering increased engagement in FCV situations and deepening understanding and new approaches in the following key frontier areas Operating in situations of fragility conflict and violence FCV CLD programs have proven particularly effective in FCV situations A review by the Bank s Independent Evaluation Group IEG found CLD approaches to be among the most frequent operational approach in the World Bank Group s FCV portfolio This is linked in part to the ability of CLD programs to reach remote or insecure areas effectively and at scale and their track record in delivering results quickly and in an inclusive manner The importance of inclusive service provision to prevent conflict was highlighted in the recent U N World Bank flagship study Pathways for Peace and the World Bank has launched a global innovation and learning program to foster the contributions of CLD programs in conflict prevention Countries that have drawn upon CLD approaches in the Africa region include Cote d Ivoire Cameroon Mali Mozambique and South Sudan Supporting local economic development Building on the successful experience of programs in South Asia as well as Latin America and the Caribbean work is underway to expand the use of CLD approaches in supporting local economic development in other regions This responds to high and growing demand including in middle income countries and includes work to facilitate market oriented investments and value chain opportunities as well as increasing community level access to finance such as through digital technologies Combatting the impacts of climate change on vulnerable populations As the climate continues to change millions of vulnerable people face greater challenges including more frequent and extreme weather events worsening health outcomes threats to food and water security unstable livelihoods and rising displacement and migration The World Bank supports CLD approaches and devolved climate finance that empower communities to drive a climate agenda in support of their development goals and promote greater transparency and accountability on climate finance for local stakeholders The World Bank is taking up these opportunities through targeted analytical work technical assistance to flagship programs around the world quality assurance support through information and knowledge exchange and by supporting staff skills development Last Updated Oct In recent years World Bank support for CLD has increasingly focused on creating national platforms to enhance service delivery and address poverty Many programs that began as stand alone operations have gradually expanded to much wider often national coverage that have become part of formal decentralization strategies and address multi sectoral issues Indonesia Launched in and building on the successful structures created under previous CLD programs the Investing in Nutrition and Early Years project is a flagship initiative by the government of Indonesia to prevent childhood stunting and invest in human capital This cross sectoral effort supports the implementation of the government s National Strategy to Accelerate Stunting Prevention Launched by the Indonesian Vice President in August the strategy commits ministries regional governments and villages to converge priority interventions across a range of sectors including health water and sanitation early childhood education social protection and agriculture and food security for households with pregnant mothers and children under age two Guinea The Guinea Support to Local Governance Project was launched in March to improve local government capacity in managing their public financial resources in a transparent and participatory manner and in mitigating local conflicts The project leverage mining revenue to finance local development opportunities and improve service delivery in lagging rural areas Phase of the project was approved in October and introduced tools and incentives to encourage communes to allocate resources towards optimizing climate resilience and adaptation Since over million USD in mining tax revenue has been transferred to all Guinean communes outside of Conakry financing sub projects in health education water and sanitation and other sectors directly benefitting an estimated million people Project Spotlight English French Philippines The KC National Community Driven Development Project KC NCDDP launched in February provided million USD in funding to support the Philippine government s primary community empowerment and poverty alleviation programs KC NCDDP empowers poor communities and has delivered strong results in some of the Philippines most remote and underserved areas including Indigenous communities It has financed sub projects that benefit million households These initiatives ranging from village roads and social services to environmental protection and community utilities have improved the lives of approximately million Indigenous households Since nearly million community volunteers have participated in the project percent of whom are women The project significantly improved access to essential infrastructure and services achieving an average percent increase across all sub project types The Philippines Community Resilience Project approved in July builds upon the successes of the KC NCDDP providing technical support to local government and community members in vulnerable municipalities across provinces enabling at risk populations to better plan for and respond to climate challenges Horn of Africa The million Development Response to Displacement Impacts Project DRDIP was launched in to improve access to basic social services including health education and water enhance environmental management and expand access to economic opportunities for host communities and refugees in Djibouti Ethiopia Kenya and Uganda The Horn of Africa plays host to over million forcibly displaced people including million refugees and asylum seekers and many are located in areas that are suffering from serious development deficits Through a grant to the Intergovernmental Authority on Development IGAD DRDIP facilitated the design and rollout of inclusive refugee policies across the Horn of Africa By addressing the strain refugee populations place on local services and the environment DRDIP aimed to turn these challenges into opportunities for host communities The project improved access to essential services such as schools health clinics roads and water systems for million people restored over hectares of degraded land and helped more than people increase their incomes through training and financing for farmers and small businesses Labor intensive public works generated over million workdays of employment and the project provided renewable energy to people helping communities strengthen their resilience and economic prospects Last Updated Oct This site uses cookies to optimize functionality and give you the best possible

all levels in education Python offers an interactive environment in which to explore procedural functional and object oriented approaches to problem solving Its high level data structures and clear syntax make it an ideal first language while the large number of existing libraries make it suitable to tackle almost any programming tasks Edu sig through its mailing list provides an informal venue for comparing notes and discussing future possibilities for Python in education Its origins trace to Guido van Rossum s pioneering Computer Programming for Everybody CP E a grant proposal accepted by DARPA and which provided a modicum of funding in Membership includes but is not limited to educators using Python in their courses independent developers and authors of educational materials Discussion focuses on Python use at all levels from beginning to advanced applications Several years ago a new version of Python was introduced This new version has some small but significant changes from the previous one The most visible change for beginners is that print which used to be a Python keyword is now a function As a result of the changes programs written for Python are likely to be incompatible with Python and vice versa Some of you may have not control over which Python version is made available to the students If that is the case you should not despair too much if you and your students do not have access to the best latest version of Python Python is a fantastic choice as a first language and the relatively minor changes between versions do not change this fact If you have some control over which version of Python is made available to the students then you have a choice to make In this case we would like to offer the following As mentioned above the Edu Sig community has its own mailing list Two other mailing lists are of potential interest to educators the python tutor and the general python list All three are available in a searchable archive on the ActiveState site which is also hosting the famous Python Cookbook The python tutor mailing list is useful to beginners learning the language and looking for answers to their programming problems educators are welcome to join as volunteers the edu sig mailing list is more for discussions about uses of Python in educational settings There are a number of freely available tutorials for Python For example there is a collection of Beginner s Guide to Python available on the Python wiki In addition the following may be of particular interest to educators While there are a number of free books and tutorials available some people prefer to have an actual copy on paper If you are among this group you might be surprised to learn that there are close to one hundred books that have been written about Python programming Here we will focus only on a subset that are of potential interest for educators who teach introductory courses in programming More books can be found here and here or by doing an internet search For children young and old University level textbooks are also available System Message WARNING string line backlink Since Python is an interpreted language all one needs to start programming is a terminal window However for your students this would not be the friendliest environment instead we recommend that you use something like IDLE which stands for Integrated DeveLopment Environment which is included in the installation Python files on any platform that supports Tcl including Windows As for yourself if you prefer programming directly from a terminal window a better choice than the default interpreter might be IPython In addition to IDLE there are a number of third party tools which you can find out by referring to the Python Editors Wiki and the Python Integrated Development Environments Wiki These are resources interactive on line tutorials and other educational resources that either help teach python or use Python to teach programming There is a growing body of podcasts screencasts and video presentations for the Python community many of which may be of interest to educators For more details please consult the Audio Video Instructional Materials for Python Given the large number of modules included in the Python distribution it is often said that Python comes with batteries included If the standard distribution does not include what you need you may want to consult the Python Package Index which is a repository that includes close to additional packages The following represent just a small sample of what is available A number of academic papers have been written about using Python as a programming language They include the following And finally while it is not an academic paper Why Python is a great language for teaching beginners in introductory programming classes by Philip Guo is certainly worth reading If it weren t for games there likely would have been many fewer people interested in programming and much less free software developped as a result Python has two well known frameworks for making games

Illustration Chen Xia GT In last minute negotiations before the UN COP summit in Brazil EU climate ministers struck a deal on a climate change target in the early hours of Wednesday Reuters reported Climate ministers from EU countries approved in a public vote a compromise to cut emissions percent by from levels but with flexibility to weaken this aim according to the report This last minute climate commitment lays bare the profound challenges facing the EU s climate agenda and the grueling negotiations behind it underscore the painful trade offs that member states face as they strive to balance sluggish economic growth energy security concerns and urgent climate commitments Against the backdrop of sluggish economic growth across the bloc industries in some EU countries are grappling with a triple squeeze high energy prices fierce global competition and the massive expenses required for the green transition This combination of factors severely undermines their capacity to accommodate stricter emission cuts and fuels socio political resistance The EU possesses distinct advantages in areas such as industrial carbon capture and advanced clean energy research and development but its green transition faces a critical bottleneck There are high costs and difficulties in the large scale promotion of cutting edge technologies which require both vast application scenarios and cost competitive supply chains The EU s internal market alone cannot meet such requirements in the short term It is precisely in addressing this predicament that the strategic value of China EU green cooperation comes into focus China has the world s most complete and cost effective industrial chain for clean energy covering photovoltaic modules wind power equipment new energy vehicles and energy storage systems Leveraging its economies of scale China can provide high quality green products at competitive prices perfectly aligning with the EU s urgent need for affordable transition solutions In the green sector China and the EU enjoy a solid foundation for cooperation and highly complementary industrial strengths with substantial space for collaboration in areas such as green product certification green finance standards and carbon emission permits trading Wang Zhihua director general of the Department of Foreign Trade of the Ministry of Commerce said at a press conference last week This complementary advantage is not just theoretical it is already bearing fruits through pragmatic cooperation For instance a Chinese energy company has formed a partnership with a leading French power company to jointly invest in and develop the Dongtai offshore wind power project the first China foreign joint venture in China s offshore wind power development Competitive tensions and trade disputes in the green sector cannot be ignored Voices within the EU that frame China as a strategic rival in clean energy are not uncommon and disputes over market access and technical standards require further alignment But to fixate solely on competition is to miss the bigger picture China and the EU share a fundamental consensus on advancing the global climate agenda and shouldering their respective responsibilities This common ground rooted in the shared recognition of climate change as an existential threat requiring collective action forms a solid foundation for collaboration This is also why there is every reason to believe that provided both sides maintain an open pragmatic and cooperative stance while enhancing communication to better understand mutual concerns and align interests they can bridge differences and forge a win win path In an era where climate targets are increasingly intertwined with economic competitiveness the significance of China EU green cooperation extends far beyond bilateral economic ties It serves as a key solution to address divisions in international climate governance and fill gaps in the supply of global public goods If China and the EU can successfully explore a cooperative model that offers a powerful demonstration to other economies of a technologically advanced and economically viable green transition pathway they will inject much needed certainty into the volatile global green transition

WASHINGTON Nov Xinhua The U S Federal Aviation Administration FAA will reduce airline traffic by percent at locations beginning on Friday as the ongoing federal government shutdown became the longest in U S history Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday We re trying to lean into the fact that when we see pressures building in these markets we just can t ignore it and we re not going to wait for a safety problem to truly manifest itself when the early indicators are telling us we can take action today to prevent things from deteriorating Duffy said I think it s going to lead to more cancellations that we re going to work with the airlines to do this in a systematic way he said at a joint press conference with FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford Bedford said that a percent reduction in scheduled capacity would be appropriate to continue to take the pressure off of our air traffic controllers and as we continue to see staffing triggers there will be additional measures that will be taken in those specific markets I m not aware in my year history in the aviation market where we ve had a situation where we re taking these kind of measures and again we re in a renewed territory in terms of government shutdowns said Bedford Since the U S federal government shutdown began about air traffic controllers and roughly airport security officers have been forced to work without pay An increasing number of employees have taken leave leading to acute staffing shortages in the aviation industry worsening flight delays across many regions and raising concerns over aviation safety Data from the U S flight tracking website FlightAware shows that thousands of flights nationwide are experiencing delays each day More than flights within into or out of the United States were delayed on Tuesday following nearly delays on Monday
Global economy to accelerate modestly to WASHINGTON Jan Weak growth among major emerging markets will weigh on global growth in but economic activity should still pick up modestly to a percent pace from percent growth in as advanced economies gain speed according to the World Bank s January Global Economic Prospects Simultaneous weakness in most major emerging markets is a concern for achieving the goals of poverty reduction and shared prosperity because those countries have been powerful contributors to global growth for the past decade Spillovers from major emerging markets will constrain growth in developing countries and pose a threat to hard won gains in raising people out of poverty the report warns More than percent of the world s poor live in the developing countries where growth slowed in said World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim Developing countries should focus on building resilience to a weaker economic environment and shielding the most vulnerable The benefits from reforms to governance and business conditions are potentially large and could help offset the effects of slow growth in larger economies Global economic growth was less than expected in when falling commodity prices flagging trade and capital flows and episodes of financial volatility sapped economic activity Firmer growth ahead will depend on continued momentum in high income countries the stabilization of commodity prices and China s gradual transition towards a more consumption and services based growth model Developing economies are forecast to expand by percent in less than expected earlier but up from a post crisis low of percent in the year just ended Growth is projected to slow further in China while Russia and Brazil are expected to remain in recession in The South Asia region led by India is projected to be a bright spot The recently negotiated Trans Pacific Partnership could provide a welcome boost to trade There is greater divergence in performance among emerging economies Compared to six months ago risks have increased particularly those associated with the possibility of a disorderly slowdown in a major emerging economy said World Bank Group Vice President and Chief Economist Kaushik Basu A combination of fiscal and central bank policies can be helpful in mitigating these risks and supporting growth Although unlikely a faster than expected slowdown in large emerging economies could have global repercussions Risks to the outlook also include financial stress around the U S Federal Reserve tightening cycle and heightened geopolitical tensions Stronger growth in advanced markets will only partially offset the risks of continued weakness in major emerging markets said World Bank Development Economic Prospects Group Director Ayhan Kose In addition the risk of financial turmoil in a new era of higher borrowing costs remains Regional Outlooks East Asia and Pacific Growth in the region is projected to continue to slow to percent in from a slightly less than expected percent in Growth in China is forecast to ease further to percent in from percent in Growth in the region excluding China was percent in broadly unchanged from as weaker growth in commodity exporters including Indonesia and Malaysia was offset by growth acceleration in Vietnam and moderate recovery in Thailand Risks include a faster than expected slowdown in China the possibility of renewed financial market turbulence and an abrupt tightening of financing conditions Europe and Central Asia Growth is projected to rise to percent in from percent in the year just ended as oil prices fall more slowly or stabilize the Russian Federation s economy improves and Ukraine recovers Economic activity in Russia is projected to contract by percent in after shrinking by percent in the year just ended Growth could resume modestly in the eastern part of the region which includes Eastern Europe South Caucasus and Central Asia if there is a stabilization of commodity prices The western part of the region which includes Bulgaria Romania Turkey and the Western Balkans should grow moderately in buoyed by recovery in the Euro Area Latin America and the Caribbean The region is projected to recover modestly from recession in with activity flat after shrinking by percent in the year just ended as the region grapples with the protracted decline of commodity prices and domestic challenges weighing on the region s largest economies However there are differences among the sub regions with stronger growth in developing Central and North America and the Caribbean offsetting weakness in South America The current recession in Brazil is expected to extend into but a return to growth is expected in Although weighed down by low oil prices and associated fiscal pressures growth is expected to pick up in Mexico thanks to dividends from implementation of structural reforms and strengthening demand from the U S market Middle East and North Africa Growth is forecast to accelerate to percent in from percent in the year just ended as the expected suspension or removal of economic sanctions against the Islamic Republic of Iran will allow that country to play a larger role in global energy markets Growth is expected to pick up in other oil exporters as well predominantly on the assumption that oil prices will stabilize The region is subject to serious risks from the possibility of an escalation of conflict a further decline in oil prices and failure to improve living conditions which could spark social unrest South Asia The region is projected to be a bright spot in the outlook for emerging and developing economies with growth speeding up to percent in from percent in the year just ended The region is a net importer of oil and will benefit from lower global energy prices At the same time because of relatively low global integration the region is shielded from growth fluctuations in other economies For FY India the dominant economy in the region is projected to grow at a faster percent and growth in Pakistan on a factor cost basis is expected to accelerate to percent Sub Saharan Africa The region is forecast to accelerate to percent in from percent in as commodity prices stabilize Economic activity will vary across Sub Saharan Africa with consumption growth remaining weak in oil exporting countries as fuel costs rise while lower inflation in oil importing countries helps boost consumer spending Nigeria is forecast to expand percent after growing by percent last year while South Africa is expected to advance only

When thinking about truth it is natural to wonder whether and how truth can be analyzed in more fundamental terms Numerous philosophers have aimed to so analyze truth but their theories are all plagued by well known problems As a result none has generated consensus or even near consensus among philosophers Primitivists about truth offer a distinctive take on this situation They suggest that this negative outcome shouldn t be surprising as there are strong reasons for thinking that truth simply cannot be analyzed in more fundamental terms We may be able to so analyze other aspects of reality and some of these may even be analyzable in terms of truth Primitivists insist though that when it comes to truth itself this sort of analysis will always come up short This entry will start by outlining a tripartite distinction between the concept of truth the property of truth and the terms that we use in speaking about truth This distinction is standard within debates about truth and it will inform the rest of the entry The entry will then provide an overview of the major varieties of primitivism about truth covering historically significant developments of the view as well as developments by contemporary philosophers Following this overview the entry will trace some nuanced connections between primitivist theories and identity deflationary and axiomatic theories of truth It will close with a brief discussion of the empirical significance of primitivism focusing on how the results of studies on false belief attribution bear on primitivist theories of the concept of truth Theories of truth can have a number of different targets Three of the most prominent targets have been i the concept truth we ll denote concepts using small caps in what follows ii the property truth we ll denote properties using italics and iii the truth terms that speakers use Philosophers have thought about the nature of the concept truth and concepts in general in various ways According to one standard way of thinking about the concept truth whatever else we might want to say about its nature and possession conditions truth is a mental entity of some sort that thinkers deploy whenever they have thoughts involving truth For instance if I believe that some of the things that Laurence said about T S Eliot are true then it would be standardly held that I deploy the concept truth in having this belief Likewise I would deploy truth if I wondered whether most of the statements in a late night infomercial were true or hoped that a scientist s optimistic predictions about climate change turn out to be true This way of thinking about truth will surface in and below In by contrast we will see that one of the most famous primitivists about truth Gottlob Frege conceived of the concept truth in an importantly different way The property truth is meant to be the property that is possessed by all and only the true truth bearers For instance suppose that propositions somehow construed are the bearers of truth The proposition that Morocco is north of Liberia is true so this proposition possesses the property truth By contrast the proposition that Zambia is north of Chad is not true so this proposition fails to possess the property truth Philosophers who have developed metaphysics of truth standardly aim to identify the nature of the property truth That said in some instances it may be more helpful to describe a theory of the metaphysics of truth as investigating the nature of a relation rather than a property A well known example is correspondence theories of truth which take truth to consist in some particular relation of correspondence between a truth bearer such as a belief or a proposition and portion of reality such as a fact Another sensible way of describing correspondence theories however is to take them to investigate the nature of the property truth where truth is meant to be a relational property see e g the introduction to the entry on the correspondence theory of truth and Edwards In what follows we will set this issue to one side and refer to truth simply as a property For further discussion of the concept property distinction in work on truth see Alston Asay c ch a b Edwards ch Eklund Lynch ch Nulty Scharp Wyatt and the references therein Truth terms are in essence the linguistic expressions that enable us to speak about truth In English truth terms include the familiar true and truth They also include correct incorrect right and wrong when the latter are used in certain sentences such as Harold believes that vaccines cause autism but his belief is wrong incorrect since vaccines don t cause autism Other natural languages come with their own stocks of truth terms For discussions of truth terms in various languages and references to further resources see e g Mizumoto Reuter and Wyatt Ulatowski As will become apparent this basic distinction between truth truth and truth terms proves to be very useful when carving up the landscape of primitivist truth theories and when identifying connections between primitivist theories and truth theories of other kinds Primitivist theories of truth were discussed extensively during the early years of the analytic tradition in philosophy and we will focus on these theories in Prior to this period we see primitivist ideas about truth emerge in Western philosophy though they appear only in an inchoate form Descartes for instance wrote in a letter to Mersenne on October that for my part I have never had any doubts about truth because it seems a notion so transcendentally clear that nobody can be ignorant of it no logical definition can be given which will help anyone to discover its nature Similarly Johann Heinrich Lambert proposed in that t ruth is a simple concept which as it does not have several internal marks can at best be defined or elucidated only through its relations to other concepts quoted in K nne If we go back much further in the history of philosophy we encounter an early Chinese philosopher whose body of thought about truth may exemplify a kind of primitivism This philosopher is Wang Chong c CE Wang lived during the Han period which Alexus McLeod b has dubbed the period of concern with truth and method in Chinese thought Wang s writings address a diverse array of topics including astronomy physics ethics metaphysics epistemology and philosophical methodology for a thorough discussion see McLeod b The only extant volume of Wang s writings is entitled Lunheng for an overview of Wang s life and his writings see McLeod b ch In Duizuo the second chapter of Lunheng Wang explains that no matter the subject that he is addressing his inquiry is animated by a foundational concern for truth In a great many books reality has no place left falsehood and immorality triumph over truth and virtue Therefore unless such lies be censured specious arguments cannot be suppressed and as long as they spread truth does not reign For this reason the Lunheng weighs the words whether they be light or heavy and holds up a balance for truth and falsehood It does not trouble about polishing the phrases and embellishing the style or consider this of great importance As Wang indicates he was troubled by the fact that falsehoods can spread more effectively than truths One of the main reasons that this occurs according to Wang is that someone who wishes to spread a falsehood often expresses it using vivid flowery language that is meant to generate strong emotions among their audience To combat this phenomenon Wang resolves to avoid flowery language and to instead express his ideas and arguments as straightforwardly as possible This he contends will enable his readers to more effectively acquire true beliefs and avoid false beliefs Given Wang s serious concern with truth it is important to consider how Wang speaks about truth when articulating his views Interestingly Wang regularly uses three pairs of truth terms shi fei ran fou and SHI xu When discussing Wang s views on truth McLeod b ch translates shi and fei as right and wrong ran and fou as is the case and is not the case and SHI and xu as true and false A somewhat different translation is offered by Lajos Brons who translates these pairs of terms as right and wrong is the case and is not the case and objective objectivity and mere attractive appearance As always translation is a tricky business especially when attempting to translate an ancient text into a contemporary language such as English Without attempting to settle upon a definitive translation of the truth terms that Wang uses we can note a few key passages from Lunheng in which these pairs of truth terms occur using McLeod s translation for the sake of convenience The Lunheng uses precise language and detailed discussion to reveal and explain the doubts of this generation of common people to bring to light through debate right and wrong principles shi fei zhi li and to help those who come later clearly see the difference between what is the case ran and what is not the case fou Duizuo quoted by McLeod b Those who can determine what is the case ran and what is not the case fou feel an ailment in their hearts which pain them at the thought of truth being subverted by the common people and flowery scholarship Mengzi s language was straight and to the point according high place to the right shi and suppressing the wrong fei Duizuo quoted by McLeod b When the ruler does badly instruction to change conduct is directed toward the person on high When the ruler s subjects are doltish engaging in discussions is directed toward the people below When the people below obtain the truth SHI then instruction of the person on high follows I hope to stir some of these minds to help them distinguish between truth SHI and falsity xu Once the distinction between truth and falsity is established then flowery and artificial writings can be eliminated When flowery and artificial writings are eliminated pure and sincere transformations will grow more abundant day by day Duizuo quoted by McLeod b As these passages illustrate Wang uses these three pairs of truth terms when developing his ideas about topics such as principles scholarship and social and political progress Notably however Wang never attempts to define these truth terms or otherwise elucidate their meanings This fact has led Lajos Brons to propose that Wang is best interpreted as being a primitivist about truth He offers the following argument t he fact that Wang in a book in which truth plays such a central role never even hinted at what truth is or what shi ran or SHI mean strongly suggests that he implicitly considered truth to be primitive Brons McLeod b points to a significant difficulty for this argument He notes that while Wang doesn t attempt to define or otherwise analyze the meanings of the truth terms that he uses this isn t terribly surprising This is because early Chinese philosophers generally don t aim to define the central philosophical terms that they use Instead they rely on other methods such as the use of case studies to illustrate what these terms mean and why the phenomena that they pick out are significant Rather than inferring from this that implicit primitivism was widespread among early Chinese philosophers the more reasonable proposal may be that there are simply deep methodological differences between early Chinese philosophy and contemporary analytic philosophy In later postscript Brons grants that we lack sufficient reasons for taking Wang to explicitly or implicitly endorse a primitivist view of truth Nevertheless Brons suggests that there is an interesting sense in which Wang s body of thought about truth exhibits a kind of primitivism Brons calls this variety of primitivism de facto primitivism about truth Focusing for the sake of simplicity on the concept truth the idea is that a body of thought exhibits de facto primitivism if one can endorse that body of thought without being committed to the definability of truth even though the body of thought does not entail that truth is undefinable Brons This Brons proposes is precisely what we find in Lunheng a set of interrelated ideas expressed using shi fei ran fou and SHI xu which doesn t entail that the concepts expressed by these terms are undefinable but which one can nevertheless endorse without taking these concepts to be amenable to definition In we will see an additional context in which the notion of de facto primitivism can be put to use For further discussion of Wang s views about truth see McLeod ch a b ch and Mou a b Having discussed Brons primitivist interpretation of Wang Chong we can move forward many years in the history of philosophy to the period when primitivist theories of truth first garnered sustained interest as such At the advent of the analytic tradition we find several of the tradition s leading lights G E Moore Bertrand Russell and Gottlob Frege developing distinctive primitivist theories of truth In his classic essay The nature of judgment Moore aims to show that contra F H Bradley the truth or falsity of a proposition cannot depend upon the proposition s relation to non propositional reality This essay was largely extracted from Moore s dissertation The metaphysical basis of ethics for which see Moore Moore takes propositions to be composed of what he calls concepts The notion of a concept which Moore uses in this essay is notably different from the notion that we briefly detailed in according to which concepts are mental entities of some sort Moore explicitly denies that concepts in his sense are mental saying that t he concept is not a mental fact nor any part of a mental fact Instead Moore takes concepts to be immutable extramental entities which are the constituents of propositions and are also what we mean in speaking and thinking He also insists that we cannot explain the nature of concepts in terms of entities of some other kind describing concepts as a genus per se irreducible to anything else Interestingly then the early Moore favors a primitivist view of concepts as well as a primitivist view of truth For further discussion of Moore s early work in metaphysics see Baldwin chs Moore argues that if the truth of a proposition consisted in its relation to reality then it would follow that contrary to fact concepts can be true or false For instance Moore contends that this view of truth entails that the concept red is true and the concept chimera is false since there are real things viz red things to which red is related though there are no real things to which chimera is related Additionally Moore suggests that there are in fact true propositions that stand in no relation to reality using the proposition that as an example These considerations lead Moore to conclude that a proposition is constituted by any number of concepts together with a specific relation between them and according to the nature of this relation the proposition may be either true or false What kind of relation makes a proposition true what false cannot be further defined but must be immediately recognised Here we see Moore advancing the view that truth and falsity are primitive properties relations In what follows we will call the view that truth is a primitive property metaphysical primitivism In lectures that were delivered in and published later as Some Main Problems of Philosophy Moore went on to reject metaphysical primitivism in favor of a correspondence theory of truth see the entry on the correspondence theory Here Moore develops two concerns for metaphysical primitivism which respectively concern his account of the facts to which true beliefs refer and the analysis of belief on which he takes metaphysical primitivism to rest Wyatt details some additional concerns that affect Moore s argument for metaphysical primitivism During the period in which Moore endorsed and later abandoned metaphysical primitivism Bertrand Russell s views on truth followed much the same trajectory In Russell the third in a trio of papers prompted by the work of Alexius Meinong Russell s main aim is to defend the view that all judgments have transcendent objects which Russell calls propositions This view carries a commitment to both true and false propositions and Russell worries about whether the latter in fact exist After wrestling with this and numerous nearby issues Russell ultimately forwards an arresting proposal that would fit perfectly in the early work of Moore there is no problem at all in truth and falsehood some propositions are true and some false just as some roses are red and some white w hat is truth and what falsehood we must merely apprehend for both seem incapable of analysis In a paper that he appears to have read to the Jowett Society in Russell is mainly concerned to argue that propositions are the bearers of truth and falsity and that true propositions are facts Along the way he twice maintains that truth is undefinable offering an argument that is strikingly similar to Frege s treadmill argument A pivotal juncture in Russell s thought about truth is his paper On the nature of truth This paper consists mostly of a critical discussion of the monistic theory of truth which Russell attributes to the British idealist Harold Joachim Having thoroughly criticized the monistic theory Russell aims in the paper s final section to offer some positive remarks about the nature of truth Here his mind is clearly divided between two views The first is a primitivist theory according to which The second view is a correspondence theory of truth according to which Russell suggests that both of these theories seem tenable and leaves the decision between them to future work That decision comes in Russell Here Russell rejects metaphysical primitivism for three reasons First the metaphysical primitivist as Russell conceives of them takes the primary bearers of truth to be propositions In opposition to this view Russell argues that we would do well to avoid positing propositions as independent entities and thus as the primary bearers of truth If propositions exist as independent entities Russell contends then it must be the case that propositions are the referents of that clauses such as that Charles I died on the scaffold However Russell is highly skeptical of referential analyses of that clauses suggesting that a that clause has no complete meaning by itself which would enable it to denote a definite object as e g the word Socrates does Russell grants that this is not a knockdown argument against the view that propositions exist as independent entities insisting nevertheless that it must be allowed a certain weight Russell s second concern for metaphysical primitivism which he takes to be more fatal arises from the fact that the metaphysical primitivist posits objective falsehoods Russell finds objective falsehoods ontologically problematic given that they would exist independently of minds yet we feel that there could be no falsehood if there were no minds to make mistakes This may be a significant concern for metaphysical primitivism One thing that should be noted however is that if the concern is forceful it would seem to cast doubt on any theory of truth which entails that there are objective falsehoods irrespective of whether that theory takes falsity to be a primitive property Russell s third concern is also meant to be fatal for metaphysical primitivism and it centers on the metaphysical primitivist s contention that truth and falsity are primitive properties Insofar as it entails that truth and falsity are primitive Russell argues metaphysical primitivism renders the distinction between truth and falsity highly mysterious whereas the correspondence theory that Russell has in mind can arguably shed a great deal of light on this distinction Russell s third concern continues to trouble philosophers considering metaphysical primitivism for further discussion see Wyatt This shift in Russell s thinking about truth away from primitivism and towards correspondence proved to be permanent Russell s endorsement of the view that truth or more specifically the truth of empirical beliefs and sentences consists in correspondence persisted for the remainder of his life though he articulated this view in various importantly different ways see the entry on the correspondence theory as well as Russell ch XII a b VI ch XIII ch chs XVI XVII and XXI Part II chs ch XV The third early analytic philosopher to endorse primitivism was Gottlob Frege and unlike Moore and Russell he remained an enduring advocate of the view Frege develops what is perhaps the best known argument for primitivism which Wolfgang K nne helpfully calls the treadmill argument The name of this argument references a metaphor that Frege uses in the posthumously published essay Logic which was likely written in In this essay he discusses the view that propositions are private and mental and are true just when they stand in a relation to a distinct entity that is neither private nor mental Frege Logic contends that given this view we could not know whether a proposition is true as we should be in the position of a man on a treadmill who makes a step forwards and upwards but the step he treads on keeps giving way and he falls back to where he was before Frege s argument for this claim Logic goes by very quickly but the argument receives a fuller development in Frege s essay The thought The more developed argument appears in the following widely discussed passage Can it not be laid down that truth exists when there is correspondence in a certain respect But in which For what would we then have to do to decide whether something were true We should have to inquire whether it were true that an idea and a reality perhaps corresponded in the laid down respect And then we should be confronted by a question of the same kind and the game could begin again So the attempt to explain truth as correspondence collapses And every other attempt to define truth collapses too For in a definition certain characteristics would have to be stated And in application to any particular case the question would always arise whether it were true that the characteristics were present So one goes round in a circle Consequently it is probable that the content of the word true is unique and indefinable Frege At the beginning of this passage Frege offers reasons for thinking that the concept truth i e the content of the word true cannot be defined as involving some kind of correspondence He then suggests that for similar reasons every purported definition of truth must fail which shows that truth is unique and indefinable We will call the view that truth is a primitive concept which Frege endorses here conceptual primitivism One detail that should be flagged in connection with the treadmill argument pertains to Frege s views about concepts We noted in that the concept truth is often understood to be mental in nature and as we will see in most conceptual primitivists have either adopted this understanding of truth or else appear sympathetic towards it Frege however has a distinctive understanding of what sort of entity the concept truth is As Frege uses the term concepts are functions from objects to truth values see Frege For Frege then concepts are mathematical in nature and they are also non mental Thus when Frege forwards the view that the concept truth is primitive it is the concept truth so conceived that he has in mind There has been substantial scholarly disagreement about how exactly the treadmill argument should be interpreted see Asay a c chs a b Baldwin Johnston Heck May Green Kim K nne Pardey Ricketts Levine Sluga Walker and the references therein For an interesting adaptation of the treadmill see Trueman The central issue here is whether we should take the argument to involve an appeal to an allegedly vicious regress or allegedly vicious circularity Given the prominence of this debate it is worthwhile to outline these two versions of the argument in detail According to the regress interpretation the treadmill s structure is essentially this cp K nne By contrast according to the circularity interpretation the treadmill has the following structure cp Asay c Selecting one of these interpretations of the treadmill is a delicate matter to be sure Whichever way the treadmill is interpreted though it faces some significant concerns To illustrate suppose that I offer the following simple definition of truth If I want to know whether a particular entity a is true then Corr suggests that I should ask whether a corresponds to a fact Frege will claim recall R C above that to determine whether a corresponds to a fact I must first determine whether the proposition that a corresponds to a fact is true However this claim is certainly debatable To know whether a corresponds to a fact it would seem that I need to know only the following things This isn t to deny of course that the proposition that a corresponds to a fact is logically equivalent to the proposition that the proposition that a corresponds to a fact is true Yet even if these propositions are logically equivalent that doesn t show that the latter is epistemically prior to the former If it isn t then the treadmill looks to falter at R C For an especially nice articulation of this concern see Asay c For a related discussion of Frege s conception of judgment and the role that it is meant to play in the treadmill see Kim Debates about truth continued to be very lively throughout the twentieth century and have maintained a great deal of momentum during the twenty first century In the twentieth century the most visible advocates of primitivism were Donald Davidson a b and Ernest Sosa a b who both defended versions of conceptual primitivism See also Rorty Savery and Strawson as well as Sluga s discussion of Carnap s views about truth Davidson s advocacy of primitivism was heavily informed by his admiration for the work of Alfred Tarski and his sense that Tarski had proved that the concept truth is undefinable Davidson b observes that in developing his theory of truth Tarski defines various truth predicates each of which is meant to apply to sentences from a particular language L By contrast Tarski doesn t attempt to define a fully general truth predicate which is meant to apply to sentences from any arbitrary language whatsoever The explanation for this Davidson contends is that Tarski proved that no such predicate can be defined Davidson takes this Tarskian proof to show by extension that our concept truth which is meant to be fully general in the above sense is also undefinable In a much cited passage Davidson summarizes the central lesson that he takes from Tarski s work as follows see also Davidson For the most part the concepts philosophers single out for attention like truth knowledge belief action cause the good and the right are the most elementary concepts we have Why then should we expect to be able to reduce these concepts definitionally to other concepts that are simpler clearer and more basic We should accept the fact that what makes these concepts so important must also foreclose on the possibility of finding a foundation for them which reaches deeper into bedrock We should apply this obvious observation to the concept of truth we cannot hope to underpin it with something more transparent or easier to grasp Truth is as G E Moore Bertrand Russell and Frege maintained and Tarski proved an indefinable concept Using a primitive concept truth Davidson went on to develop a program in semantics whose influence cannot be overstated A central idea of this program is that the meaning of a linguistic expression consists in its contribution to the truth conditions of the sentences in which it occurs This idea is also based on the work of Tarski who explored definitions of truth based on biconditionals such as Davidson s approach is to treat a Tarskian theory of truth as being a theory of what the sentences that are used by a particular speaker mean If is entailed by such a theory which is attributed to a particular speaker A then the theory also entails that when A uses the sentence Morocco is north of Liberia A means that Morocco is north of Liberia see e g Davidson and cp Davidson This proposal regarding the relationship between truth and meaning illustrates a more general feature of the methodology for investigating truth that Davidson ultimately came to endorse This method has it that instead of trying to analyze truth in terms of more basic concepts we should instead attempt to identify significant connections between truth and other concepts that we use One such connection is that between truth and meaning which Davidson takes his application of Tarski s ideas to reveal P F Strawson ch helpfully describes this approach as the connective model of conceptual analysis For further discussion of Davidson s methodology and the ways in which he applies it see the entry on Donald Davidson and Glanzberg A significant concern for Davidson is that while Tarski s work on truth undoubtedly marks a watershed moment in the history of philosophy it is not at all clear that Tarski proved that truth is a primitive concept The theorem concerning truth that Tarski proved concerns specific formal languages Described in rudimentary terms the theorem has it that if a formal language L has a particular degree of expressive power then truth for the sentences of L cannot be defined in L This theorem is about truth predicates for specific kinds of formal languages rather than truth which is meant to be a concept that is possessed by speakers of a highly diverse range of natural languages For this reason Tarski s undefinability theorem doesn t provide clear support for conceptual primitivism Yet even if this is so Davidson s understanding of the import of Tarski s work may still point us in the right direction A notable view in the vicinity of Davidson s is that while Tarski didn t exactly prove that truth is primitive Tarski s views about truth fit more naturally with conceptual primitivism than with other theories of truth such as correspondence or deflationary theories For a defense of this view and the above criticism of Davidson see Asay b c ch For further discussion of Tarski s thought about truth see Halbach chs Horsten chs Patterson and the entry on Tarski s truth definitions Ernest Sosa has sided with Davidson in holding that t ruth is a primitive concept and has no illuminating definition or Moorean analysis Sosa s ambition in his discussions of conceptual primitivism is to provide an account of truth that i is compatible with a truth centered epistemology according to which epistemic concepts such as knowledge and epistemic justification must be analyzed in terms of truth and ii is compatible with external realism according to which external reality is not dependent on human thought and might have been just as it is now even in our absence and even in the absence of any contingent thinkers whatever Sosa argues for conceptual primitivism by elimination offering various concerns for competing accounts of truth including noncognitivist pragmatist and correspondence theories The noncognitivist account that Sosa discusses is based in the work of Richard Rorty who maintained that the word true is merely an expression of commendation Rorty The corresponding account of the concept truth has it that the sole function of truth is to commend beliefs theories assertions etc with which one agrees Against this account Sosa points out that it seems to succumb to the embedding problem that is standardly raised against noncognitivist theories For instance consider the belief that if what Barry said about Susan is true then Susan will come to the dinner party In forming this belief I deploy truth However it would seem that in doing so I don t commend what Barry said or anything else for that matter see also Sosa and see Schroeder for further discussion of expressivism about truth The pragmatist account of truth that Sosa considers is based in the thought of C S Peirce A proponent of this account aims to explicate truth by proposing that a true belief is one that would be accepted rationally and justifiably by ideal inquirers in an ideal epistemic situation for that belief and its subject matter Sosa This account explicates truth using the concepts rationality and epistemic justification Accordingly Sosa points out that a defender of the account faces the challenge of analyzing the latter concepts in truth free terms lest they be caught up in vicious circularity While this sort of project may have some potential undertaking it is clearly a tall order given that it seems highly natural to analyze rationality and epistemic justification in terms of truth Thirdly Sosa considers correspondence theories of truth according to which the sentences on our lips or in our brains are true when and only when they correspond appropriately with the facts or with reality Sosa suggests that the success of such correspondence theories will depend upon the development of a satisfactory theory of reference which is likely to take reference to consist in the obtaining of certain causal relations see e g Field He also notes that despite a great deal of work in this area we seem to lack such a theory of reference which calls the prospects of such correspondence theories into question It is worthwhile to note that the correspondence theories which Sosa has in mind here would seem to be theories of the nature of the property truth rather than theories of the concept truth The aim of such theories is to articulate the conditions under which a sentence is true which can be naturally regarded as the conditions that must be met for a sentence to possess truth By contrast the correspondence theories at issue aren t meant to be theories of how we ordinarily think about truth which indicates that they aren t meant to shed light on our concept truth For this reason such correspondence theories aren t obviously competitors with Sosa s conceptual primitivism given that one can consistently defend rather different theories of truth and truth on this point see e g Alston as well as For further critical discussion of Sosa s views about truth and its role in epistemology see McGrath Fantl Colin McGinn has put forward a primitivist account of truth that he calls thick disquotationalism Thick disquotationalism is primitivist at both the conceptual and the metaphysical levels though admittedly the concept property distinction proves to be slippery when it surfaces in McGinn s discussion The signature theses of thick disquotationalism include TD might seem to be inconsistent with both TD and TD but McGinn argues to the contrary McGinn s arguments for the non circular definability of truth and truth appeal to what he calls the disquotation principle Disquotation principle is actually a misnomer for the principle that McGinn has in mind here he acknowledges this on but persists in using this name for the principle As Quine famously explains disquotation is meant to be a procedure that applies to the quotation names of sentences such as However McGinn s favored truth bearers are propositions rather than sentences As a result the principle on which he draws is in fact Paul Horwich s Equivalence Schema for further discussion of Horwich s views see and the entry on deflationism about truth The Equivalence Schema has it that McGinn s argument for the non circular definability of truth turns on the claim that truth can be defined as the one and only self effacing property To say that truth is self effacing is to say that we can state truth s instantiation conditions without referring to truth itself McGinn takes ES to show us that truth is self effacing Consider an instance of ES such as McGinn would suggest that tells us which condition is both necessary and sufficient for the proposition that Zambia is north of Chad to possess truth This condition is just that Zambia is north of Chad Notably when we describe this condition we don t need to use true truth or any other expression that could be reasonably taken to denote or express truth In this way it seems that we are able to say what it takes for a given proposition to possess truth without explicitly or implicitly mentioning truth McGinn s contention is that truth is the only property that behaves in this way In light of this contention he puts forward the following definition of truth McGinn suggests that defining truth as the one and only self effacing property is compatible with the view that truth is primitive in that it lacks an underlying empirical nature In this way McGinn takes truth s primitiveness to be compatible with its non circular definability For discussion of a number of apparent counterexamples to McGinn s contention that truth is the only self effacing property see Wrenn Turning to McGinn s argument for the non circular definability of truth the details are much the same McGinn s contention here is that truth is non circularly definable insofar as its application conditions can be stated without using another concept C that is extensionally or intensionally identical to truth This fact is again meant to be demonstrated by ES McGinn suggests that it is suitable to read ES as telling us that truth applies to a proposition p iff p This means that from ES we learn for instance that truth applies to the proposition that Zambia is north of Chad iff Zambia is north of Chad In articulating the right hand side of this biconditional we seem to have used neither truth nor any concept that is extensionally or intensionally identical to truth Taking truth to be defined by ES in this way looks to be compatible with the view that it is not possible to decompose truth into simpler concepts For this reason McGinn takes truth s primitiveness to also be compatible with its non circular definability Wrenn VII points to a significant question that can be raised for McGinn s argument for the non circular definability of truth The question is whether schemas such as ES can be properly regarded as definitions If schemas shouldn t be regarded as definitions then McGinn s argument for truth s non circular definability seems to be seriously flawed which calls TD into question Notably though this potential flaw doesn t put pressure on McGinn s conceptual primitivism This is because it doesn t call into question the idea that truth cannot be decomposed into simpler concepts i e TD For further discussion of related issues see and the entry on definitions In the twenty first century primitivism has been endorsed often briefly by an extensive range of philosophers Here we will focus on the most detailed twenty first century defenses of primitivism These come respectively from Trenton Merricks Timothy Nulty Douglas Patterson and Jamin Asay For additional endorsements see Armstrong Boghossian Hinzen Khatchadourian i ii MacFarlane McLeod x b Lowe Rumfitt Schaffer Simionato Wiggins n and B Williams See also Zalta Merricks ch puts forward a notable variety of metaphysical primitivism according to which truth is a monadic i e non relational non intrinsic property that cannot be analyzed at least when it is exemplified by its primary bearers He offers two reasons for taking truth to be a monadic property The first is that truth according to Merricks cannot be a relation between a truth bearer e g a proposition or a belief and some other entity or entities note the parallel with Moore s criticisms of Bradley Merricks supports this claim by developing a systematic case for the view that some truths lack truthmakers i e that some truth bearers are true even though they are not true in virtue of standing in a relation to a certain entity or entities A running example is negative existential propositions such as the proposition that hobbits do not exist which Merricks argues cannot be made true by any existing entity or entities While Merricks denies that truth is a relation he nevertheless argues V that truth exists by presenting two concerns for a deflationary view according to which it fails to exist Combining his denial that truth is a relation with his affirmation of truth s existence Merricks concludes that truth must be a monadic property An interesting wrinkle is that while Merricks takes truth to be monadic he also insists that truth is non intrinsic given that whether a proposition exemplifies truth is often a matter of how things are around it For instance Merricks would hold that even though truth is not itself a relation the truth of the proposition that apples are solid is determined not just by the nature of that proposition but also by the solidity of apples Having concluded that truth is monadic Merricks suggests that if truth were analyzable then it would have to be analyzable in terms of monadic properties that are exemplified by all and only the true truth bearers Yet he takes the latter hypothesis to be highly dubious pointing briefly to a characteristic remark by Russell e g to the effect that the truth of a belief cannot be plausibly taken to consist in intrinsic properties of the belief such as its vividness This leads Merricks to infer that truth is not analyzable and is thus a primitive property While it is sharply formulated Merricks argument for metaphysical primitivism may proceed a bit too quickly In particular it is worth noting that the remark by Russell which Merricks uses to motivate metaphysical primitivism concerns beliefs intrinsic properties rather than their monadic properties Since Merricks takes some monadic properties to be non intrinsic an appeal to this remark looks to be out of place in Merricks argument Merricks response to this concern might very well be concessive given that he maintains that t he monadicity of truth is the main point here Its primitivity is not essential to the other claims about truth made in this chapter or indeed in this book These remarks show that Merricks sees metaphysical primitivism in contrast to the view that truth is monadic as a highly negotiable aspect of his overall views on truth and truthmaking For an additional response to Merricks on behalf of truth pluralism see Edwards ch See also Griffith and Rasmussen ch Timothy Nulty has defended a variety of conceptual primitivism that he calls primitive disclosive alethism In defending primitive disclosive alethism Nulty offers three main reasons for taking truth to be primitive which are based on ideas from Davidson and Martin Heidegger The first reason involves the Heideggerian idea that we don t take true assertions to agree with things that they represent but instead take true assertions to point to or reveal particular parts of reality see Heidegger Nulty endorses this idea proposing as well that the relation of pointing to revealing isn t analyzable in more fundamental terms This is meant to show that truth is not analyzable in more fundamental terms This argument doesn t clearly provide a reason for taking truth to be primitive The Heideggerian proposal at issue here seems to involve analyzing truth in terms of pointing revealing If the latter concepts are more fundamental than truth then this Heideggerian proposal actually militates against conceptual primitivism A key question to be investigated then is whether we should take pointing revealing to be more or less fundamental than or perhaps equifundamental with truth This is a question that should presumably be investigated using the methods of cognitive science for a discussion of related topics see Nulty s second reason for taking truth to be primitive specifically concerns purported definitions of truth in terms of correspondence These definitions he suggests will define truth in terms of a correspondence between truth bearers and certain parts of reality e g facts that are meant to exist independently of human thought and language Nulty argues however that when we carve reality up into parts such as facts this carving is ineliminably informed by human biology and human social practices including our linguistic practices For this reason he finds the idea that there is a privileged carving of reality which is correct independent of human thought and language to be suspect On this basis Nulty contends that truth cannot be defined in correspondence theoretic terms One limitation of this argument is that it seems possible to offer a correspondence theoretic definition of truth which doesn t fit the mold that Nulty has detailed One might define truth in terms of a correspondence between truth bearers e g beliefs and facts while also taking the existence of facts to be somehow constrained by human thought and or language In effect this would amount to a combination of a correspondence theory of truth with a variety of anti realism about facts While such a combination would be atypical it nevertheless appears to be internally consistent For an observation along the same lines see of the entry on the correspondence theory of truth Note also that McTaggart held a nearby view which combines a correspondence theory of truth with a form of ontological idealism see of the entry on John M E McTaggart Nulty s third reason for taking truth to be primitive is that as Davidson and Heidegger emphasized for something to be a thinking subject it must possess truth This means that one must possess truth to possess any other concepts which indicates that truth is primitive of this entry will discuss evidence from developmental and comparative psychology that bears on this line of argument Douglas Patterson has laid out a distinctive take on the idea that truth is a primitive concept according to which the conception of truth is circular As Patterson uses the term the conception of the concept truth is the set of claims about truth that anyone who possesses truth must be disposed to accept upon consideration Patterson calls claims of this sort conceptually analytic for the concept truth Patterson s conceptual primitivism has it that the conception of truth is circular in that upon analysis all of the claims that constitute truth s conception turn out to involve truth Extending the metaphor in the passage from Davidson quoted in we can say that Patterson s core contention is that the conception of truth does not reach deeper into bedrock insofar as its conception is shot through with instances of truth Patterson provides two main reasons for taking truth s conception to be circular in this way For a third reason that he presents very briefly see The first is the conjecture that when asked What is truth ordinary speakers will not be disposed to offer non circular responses to this question Patterson takes this to indicate that the concept truth which ordinary speakers possess has a circular conception Upon reflection it should be clear that Patterson is putting forward an empirical conjecture here that should in turn be evaluated empirically To date the only extant empirical data which bear directly on Patterson s conjecture are the qualitative data that were reported by Arne N ss a b Further work would be needed to determine whether N ss data confirm or disconfirm Patterson s conjecture Other relevant data include those of Barnard Ulatowski K lbel Mizumoto Reuter and Reuter Brun Patterson s second motivation for his conceptual primitivism is that every extant theory according to which truth has a non circular conception is highly problematic Summarizing briefly Patterson takes deflationary theories of truth to be unsatisfactory insofar as they invite either the problem of necessity or the problem of paradox The problem of necessity is meant to have two aspects i that deflationary theories misidentify the set of claims that are conceptually analytic for truth and ii that deflationary theories implausibly entail that anyone who possesses truth must know the meaning of every English expression The problem of paradox is meant to be that we can derive logical falsehoods from deflationary theories of truth given the familiar suite of semantic paradoxes such as the Liar paradox Patterson takes minimalist theories of truth such as that of Horwich which he regards as being distinct from deflationary theories to be unsatisfactory as they cannot deliver a satisfying account of what it is for a sentence or an utterance to express a proposition Patterson He takes traditional substantivist theories of truth e g correspondence coherence or pragmatist theories to be problematic because they either turn out to be circular or to misidentify the intension and in some cases the extension of truth Finally Patterson takes pluralist theories of truth to be inadequate as they either inherit the problems with deflationary theories or misidentify truth s intension Patterson s criticisms here are all highly nuanced and they deserve extended consideration An issue that should be flagged though is one that dovetails with the apparent shortcoming in Patterson s first motivation for conceptual primitivism A claim to the effect that truth or any concept for that matter has such and so intension or extension or that a given theory misidentifies truth s intension or extension would seem to be empirical in nature Whether a claim of either of these sorts is true or false hinges on what truth s intension or extension actually is and that is presumably an empirical matter Accordingly while armchair reflection on a conjecture of either of these sorts may lend it some initial credibility it must ultimately be evaluated in light of empirical evidence regarding how ordinary thinkers or ordinary English speakers or whoever the target population are think about truth Lastly over an extensive body of work Jamin Asay a b c a b has developed the most thorough and nuanced defense of primitivism to date Primitivism is standardly viewed as a rival to deflationism which has been one of the most popular approaches to truth see e g Burgess Burgess K nne Figs and Lynch Wyatt Kim and Kellen and Wright A core thesis of deflationary theories of truth is that truth is insubstantial in that i we can t say anything very interesting about its nature and ii it lacks explanatory power for further discussion see of this entry the entry on deflationism about truth as well as Edwards ch Eklund Scharp Wyatt a and the references therein With the concept property distinction in view it is easy to see that there are at least two levels so to speak at which one might be a deflationist one might be a deflationist about truth or one might be a deflationist about truth or both For his part Asay argues that we should accept a version of deflationism about truth while firmly rejecting deflationism about truth opting instead for primitivism about truth Asay then is a conceptual primitivist and a metaphysical deflationist so it is useful to call his theory of truth primitivist deflationism For a different case for combining deflationism with primitivism see Greimann Primitivist deflationism consists of four core theses With regard to Fundamentality the initial idea is that we can think of our concepts as being arranged in a dependence structure To possess a concept that is higher up in this structure one must possess one or more concepts that are lower down though not vice versa To say that truth is fundamental then is to say that truth resides at the ground level of this structure that there is no concept C such that to possess truth one must possess C but not vice versa Explanatory Indispensability sets up a link between Asay s views and those of Davidson Both Asay and Davidson reject deflationism about truth insofar as they take truth to have explanatory power That is they hold that there are phenomena that we just can t explain without using truth One of these phenomena is linguistic meaning As explained in Davidson maintained that a declarative sentence has a certain meaning because it has certain truth conditions Asay concurs c and infers that to explain the nature of linguistic meaning we cannot do without truth We will say more about the connections between primitivist and deflationary theories in Omnipresence rests on a contrast between two kinds of components of propositional thoughts where a propositional thought is a state of mind such as believing regretting or imagining that has propositional content According to Asay some of the components of propositional thoughts are aboutness determining in that they partially determine what a propositional thought is about By contrast he takes other components of propositional thoughts to be structural in that they partially determine the structure of a propositional thought without determining what it is about For example we can regard the belief that stones are not liquid as being composed of the concepts stone liquid and propositional negation It is fair to say that this belief is about stones and liquidity which means that stone and liquid are aboutness determining components of the belief By contrast it seems that the belief isn t about negation Rather negation looks to be a structural component of the belief Omnipresence is the claim that truth is similar to negation except that truth is a structural component of every propositional thought Asay a c a defends Omnipresence via the omnipresence argument which is meant to be a new and improved successor to Frege s treadmill argument Lastly as a metaphysical deflationist Asay maintains that while the property truth isn t primitive it is nevertheless a merely insubstantial property One of Asay s main concerns for metaphysical primitivism is that it looks to entail that facts about which truth bearers are aren t true are objectionably mysterious c a As we saw in Russell also took this to be a serious problem with metaphysical primitivism Asay s central idea in connection with truth s insubstantiality is that while truth does exist this property lacks the explanatory power that is enjoyed by what David Lewis called sparse or natural properties In this respect Asay s views about truth are the polar opposite of his views about truth Asay s primitivist deflationism is a novel and provocative theory will briefly examine its prospects in light of relevant empirical findings on false belief attribution For discussion of a range of concerns that can be raised for the theory see Collins and Wyatt b Table provides a brief overview of the major primitivist theories of truth An asterisk signifies that the relevant primitivist interpretation is controversial There are a number of multifaceted connections between primitivist truth theories and truth theories of other kinds This section will provide an overview of the ways in which primitivist theories are related to identity theories deflationary theories and axiomatic theories of truth According to identity theories of truth a proposition p is true iff p is identical to a fact In the literature on identity theories the following question has loomed large should an identity theorist be a primitivist about the property truth There is a fair amount of consensus that the answer to this question is Yes It is standardly held that in the period in which Moore and Russell took truth to be primitive they also endorsed identity theories of truth see the entry on the identity theory of truth and Cartwright In a similar fashion Frege remarks near the end of The thought Facts facts facts cries the scientist if he wants to emphasize the necessity of a firm foundation for science What is a fact A fact is a thought that is true This remark suggests that in addition to holding that truth is primitive Frege may have endorsed an identity theory of truth Given the concept property distinction this view appears to at least be internally consistent See also Candlish n on Meinong s views about truth For a critical discussion of the view that Frege and the early Moore and Russell endorsed identity theories of truth see Asay c Jennifer Hornsby a leading contemporary advocate of an identity theory of truth claims in her highly influential paper on the topic that her identity theory of truth acknowledges truth s indefinability n Julian Dodd another leading identity theorist emphasizes likewise that what he calls modest identity theories are compatible with the view that truth cannot be defined Additionally Colin Johnston nn has argued that if an identity theory of truth is paired with a dual relation rather than a multiple relation theory of judgment then if a judgment s truth condition obtains doesn t obtain the fact that it obtains doesn t obtain is brute See also Engel s criticism of what he calls an identity theory of facts one version of which entails that truth is primitive as well as Candlish Damnjanovic Working in the opposite direction Nulty argues that his primitive disclosive alethism is importantly distinct from identity theories of truth More recently Richard Gaskin chs has defended an identity theory of truth which he takes to motivate the view that truth is an undefinable property Gaskin takes the bearers of truth to be Russellian propositions which are meant to be composed of particulars such as Socrates and properties such as being wise He asks us to consider a correspondence theory of truth which takes truth to consist in correspondence between Russellian propositions and obtaining states of affairs that are numerically distinct from those propositions Gaskin s concern for such a theory is founded in the thought that there is no linguistic distance between the ways in which we talk about propositions and the ways in which we talk about states of affairs He notes that we use that clauses such as that Socrates is wise to pick out both propositions and states of affairs Moving a step further he says l et us ask why is the proposition that Socrates is wise true If I reply by saying that it is true because it corresponds to an obtaining state of affairs namely that Socrates is wise I seem to have explained nothing but merely repeated the explanandum Given that he takes sentences of the form Proposition p is true and Proposition p corresponds to an obtaining state of affairs to have the same content Gaskin concludes that we cannot explain why true propositions are true by mentioning that they correspond to obtaining states of affairs Instead Gaskin s proposal is that true propositions are identical to obtaining states of affairs and false propositions are identical to non obtaining states of affairs This identity theory is meant to better reflect the lack of linguistic distance between our ways of talking about propositions and states of affairs Moreover Gaskin argues this theory entails that truth is undefinable According to the theory the proposition p is true iff it is identical to an obtaining state of affairs fact Remarking on this general statement Gaskin urges that it is hard to see that much of substance has thereby been said about truth That is Gaskin takes this general statement about truth to fall short of a definition of truth insofar as it fails to illuminate truth s underlying nature His reason appears to again be that the left and right hand sides of this biconditional have the same content see Gaskin also argues that his identity theory takes truth to be an intrinsic property insofar as it entails that the truth of an atomic proposition does not consist in that proposition s standing in a relation to some distinct entity x see also of his entry on the identity theory of truth In this respect Gaskin s variety of metaphysical primitivism is notably distinct from the variety that is defended by Merricks A more challenging comparison is that between primitivist and deflationary theories of truth Deflationists have observed that the traditional project of attempting to uncover the essence of the property truth has yielded little in the way of consensus They take this to be a strong motivation for abandoning this traditional project and instead regarding truth as being at most a merely insubstantial property Given this attitude towards truth deflationists aim instead to identify the signature roles that the concept truth and truth terms play in our cognition and languages The comparison between primitivist and deflationary theories is challenging because at first blush these look like very similar ways of thinking about truth Primitivists and deflationists both stand in opposition to the traditional project of trying to analyze the nature of truth As such both primitivist and deflationary theories seem to entail in effect that there isn t much to say about truth cp McGrath Paul Horwich a leading deflationist about truth has even described true as a primitive term Horwich This raises the question of whether we should think of deflationary and primitivist accounts of truth truth and truth terms as really converging on the same set of core ideas While primitivist and deflationary theories do exhibit a certain degree of convergence the extent of this convergence shouldn t be overstated Consider truth terms first focusing in particular on Horwich s minimalist account of true In the passage mentioned above one of Horwich s central claims is that true cannot be explicitly defined e g using a definition of the following form see also Horwich n In this respect Horwich s views regarding truth terms converge with a variety of primitivism that was not covered in as it is not defended by the main proponents of primitivist theories of truth This variety of primitivism concerns truth terms rather than the concept truth or the property truth According to this view which we can call term primitivism the word true and perhaps all other truth terms is not analyzable in terms of more fundamental linguistic expressions However there is another key respect in which minimalism and term primitivism diverge Horwich s view is that when we explain what true means the best strategy is to identify the fact about how true is used which explains why it means what it does According to Horwich this fact is that the community of speakers who use true are disposed to accept every instance of the Equivalence Schema in the absence of supporting evidence This leads Horwich to conclude that while true cannot be explicitly defined it can be implicitly defined namely by the Equivalence Schema Horwich It is here that minimalism parts company with term primitivism ES contains the term proposition and the minimalist takes ES to implicitly define true This means that if the minimalist held that the meaning of true is more fundamental than that of proposition then their implicit definition of true would be viciously circular Being cognizant of this Horwich argues that the meaning of proposition is more fundamental than that of true Horwich Postscript see also Putting the pieces together this means that while the minimalist denies that true is explicitly definable they nevertheless accept that true is implicitly definable in terms of a more fundamental expression namely proposition Insofar as implicitly defining a term is one though certainly not the only way of analyzing it the minimalist is committed to holding that true is analyzable in terms of a more fundamental linguistic expression In this respect minimalism and term primitivism are fundamentally at odds For a similar observation see Horwich See Fischer Zicchetti and Nicolai for further discussion of deflationism and primitivism about truth terms Primitivist and deflationary theories also differ in important ways at both the conceptual and metaphysical levels Regarding the concept truth these two sorts of theory converge insofar as they entail that truth cannot be analyzed in terms of concepts like correspondence coherence or verifiability As discussed in however they diverge when it comes to truth s explanatory power Primitivists most notably Davidson and Asay argue that truth has explanatory power e g in theories of the nature of linguistic meaning or the nature of assertion whereas deflationists deny that it has such explanatory power this point is echoed by Candlish Damnjanovic cf Fisher Turning to truth deflationists like primitivists characteristically hold that truth cannot be defined or analyzed in terms of more fundamental properties or relations see e g Horwich ch see also Fisher However there are at least three significant respects in which deflationary and primitivist theories of truth diverge The first is that certain deflationists including Ayer Brandom Grover Quine Ramsey and Strawson have denied or else would deny that truth exists These deflationists we might call them pure deflationists since they advocate an eliminative metaphysics of truth must clearly reject primitivism about truth This is because primitivism about truth entails that truth does exist Cp Strollo Merricks ch V emphasizes this difference when arguing that his primitivism is preferable to deflationism On the relationship between Davidson s conceptual primitivism and pure deflationism see Salis A second detail to mention is that deflationists who do take truth to exist we can call them moderate deflationists characteristically hold that truth lacks explanatory power see e g Dodd Horwich Postscript and M Williams for further discussion see Wyatt III It is open to a primitivist about truth to deny this claim much as Davidson and Asay do with regard to the concept truth This means that when it comes to the choice between primitivism and deflationism about truth a central consideration is again whether truth has or lacks explanatory power cp Edwards Fisher Strollo and Wyatt A third key difference is that primitivists and moderate deflationists offer different reasons for thinking that truth cannot be defined or analyzed in terms of more fundamental properties or relations see Dodd ch n and cp Fisher The distinctive deflationary reason due to Horwich is that we can apparently explain the cognitive and linguistic behavior of truth and true by supposing that they are mere expressive devices The specific deflationary claims here are that If these claims are correct Horwich argues then true is not used to attribute to certain entities i e statements beliefs etc an ordinary sort of property a characteristic whose underlying nature will account for its relations to other ingredients of reality By contrast the motivations for primitivist theories of truth are quite different A review of and of this entry will make this very apparent For more on the differences between primitivist and deflationary theories see McGrath and Sosa a D A final connection to explore is that between primitivist and axiomatic theories of truth For discussion of the motivations for and details of various axiomatic theories of truth see Fujimoto Halbach Halbach and Horsten Axiomatic theories of truth concern truth predicates that are meant to apply to sentences of particular formal languages Unlike traditional theories of truth such as correspondence coherence or pragmatic theories axiomatic theories aren t founded on the presupposition that these truth predicates are definable Advocates of axiomatic theories wish to avoid this presupposition in light of Tarski s theorem concerning the undefinability of truth for certain formal languages Rather than attempting to define the truth predicates with which they are concerned advocates of axiomatic theories propose axioms that govern the behavior of these predicates For instance suppose that we are interested in offering a theory of truth for an object language L which does not contain any semantic vocabulary Using corner quotes as a naming device a particularly straightforward axiom for a truth predicate T that applies only to L sentences would be for discussion of axiomatic theories of truth which follow along these basic lines see Fujimoto Halbach Halbach ch and Horsten ch In this way axiomatic theories treat their target truth predicates as primitive predicates However it is also important to note that endorsing a particular axiomatic theory of truth doesn t commit one to holding that the truth predicate that it concerns is undefinable Kentaro Fujimoto and Volker Halbach bring this point out particularly well see also Halbach Axiomatic approaches to truth knowledge or other notions do not rule out the possibility of a definition for the notion in question a notion that is taken as primitive can turn out to be definable after all On an axiomatic approach one just does not presuppose that the notion is definable Once it has been set out what is expected from the notion one can investigate whether a notion satisfying these conditions is definable or eliminable in some sense This fact about axiomatic theories of truth sheds some light on the sense in which they are primitivist theories of truth Here it is useful to recall Brons contention that Wang Chong was a de facto primitivist The idea is that although Wang never explicitly claims that the concept truth is primitive this concept nevertheless operates as an undefined concept within his body of thought If truth so operates one can endorse all of Wang s views without committing oneself to the definability of truth However that Wang is a de facto primitivist doesn t entail that anyone who endorses Wang s views is committed to the undefinability of truth The motivations for and details of axiomatic theories of truth are of course very different from Wang s motivations and the details of his writings Nevertheless it is fair to say that axiomatic theories of truth are de facto primitivist theories In an axiomatic theory of truth the truth predicates that the theory axiomatizes operate as primitive predicates but the theory doesn t entail that these predicates are undefinable Accordingly as Fujimoto and Halbach underscore someone who endorses an axiomatic theory isn t committed to the definability of the truth predicates that the theory axiomatizes nor are they are committed to these predicates undefinability A final issue to consider is the empirical significance of primitivist theories of truth Conceptual primitivism is particularly relevant here as it may find support from the extensive body of research on false belief tasks For further discussion see Nulty and Ulatowski Wyatt On this and other relevant sources of empirical evidence concerning truth see Asay b S S Brons Burge Hinzen Ulatowski von Heiseler Wyatt and Wyatt Ulatowski False belief tasks are employed by psychologists to study theory of mind which is our cognitive capacity to attribute mental states in attempting to make sense of the behavior of agents cp Spaulding In particular a large number of psychologists have used false belief tasks to determine when humans as well as other primates such as great apes attribute false beliefs see Ulatowski Wyatt In their landmark study Heinz Wimmer and Josef Perner describe a familiar type of false belief task as follows In order to test subjects comprehension of the other person s wrong belief stories like the following were constructed A story character Maxi puts chocolate into a cupboard x In his absence his mother displaces the chocolate from x into cupboard y Subjects have to indicate the box where Maxi will look for the chocolate when he returns Only when they are able to represent Maxi s wrong belief Chocolate is in x apart from what they themselves know to be the case Chocolate is in y will they be able to point correctly to box x This procedure tests whether subjects have an explicit and definite representation of the other s wrong belief Yet there is neither a problem in framing the test question by using mental verbs e g What does Maxi believe nor are subjects required to verbalize their knowledge about other s beliefs since a mere pointing gesture suffices The body of evidence from the false belief task literature seems to bear directly on at least some varieties of conceptual primitivism Consider for instance Asay s Fundamentality thesis truth is a fundamental concept in Asay s sense iff truth is either innate or among the initial set of concepts that we acquire in the course of cognitive development Asay puts this point crisply when he remarks that truth is among our most basic and fundamental concepts a concept without which as Davidson aptly claims we would have no concepts at all Thus if the body of evidence on false belief tasks strongly supports either of the hypotheses at issue here then it supports the Fundamentality thesis in turn and to that extent supports conceptual primitivism Our current data should be at least somewhat encouraging to advocates of Fundamentality Baillargeon Buttelmann and Southgate point out that t here are now over published reports spanning different methods providing convergent evidence for false belief understanding in children ages months If these studies are on the right track then it looks as though very young children are able to attribute false beliefs Since they can attribute false beliefs it would seem that these children must possess the concept falsity Moreover it is highly probable that if they possess falsity then they also possess truth So absent compelling counterevidence that children acquire truth in virtue of possessing more fundamental concepts it can be reasonably inferred that the body of false belief task evidence supports Fundamentality This line of argument seems promising though properly evaluating it will require attention to a number of issues One is whether we should follow researchers such as Baillargeon Buttelmann and Southgate in offering a mentalistic interpretation of the false belief task data according to which they indicate that young children are able to attribute mental states like belief Tyler Burge has recently proposed an alternative non mentalistic interpretation of the data and the jury is out on which of these and a number of other interpretations is the best for criticism of Burge s interpretation see Carruthers and Jacob Another relevant issue is whether as Peter Carruthers has argued infants can represent beliefs while lacking an explicit detachable symbolically represented concept truth as well as presumably an explicit concept falsity Carruthers proposal suggests that passing some false belief tasks e g the active helping task used by Buttelmann Carpenter and Tomasello may require possession of truth whereas passing others e g the change of location task of Wimmer and Perner may not Accordingly it may be that only some of the false belief task data lend support to Fundamentality Bradley Francis Herbert Davidson Donald definitions Frege Gottlob Heidegger Martin liar paradox Meinong Alexius Moore George

Tertiary Education is instrumental in fostering growth reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity It benefits not just the individual but the entire educational system Tertiary education refers to all formal post secondary education including public and private universities colleges technical training institutes and vocational schools Tertiary education is instrumental in fostering growth reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity A highly skilled workforce with lifelong access to a solid post secondary education is a prerequisite for innovation and growth well educated people are more employable and productive earn higher wages and cope with economic shocks better Tertiary education benefits not just the individual but society as a whole Graduates of tertiary education are more environmentally conscious have healthier habits and have a higher level of civic participation Also increased tax revenues from higher earnings healthier children and reduced family size all build stronger nations In short tertiary education institutions prepare individuals not only by providing them with adequate and relevant job skills but also by preparing them to be active members of their communities and societies The economic returns for tertiary education graduates are the highest in the entire educational system an estimated increase in earnings as compared with for primary and for secondary education These high returns are even greater in Sub Saharan Africa at an estimated increase in earning for tertiary education graduates As the youth population continues to swell and graduation rates through elementary and secondary education increase dramatically especially in regions like South Asia Sub Saharan Africa Latin America and the Middle East and North Africa there is an intensifying demand for expanded access to tertiary education of good quality Diversification of institution types and delivery modalities will become increasingly more central to meeting this expanded demand Tertiary technical and vocational education and training as one example can provide an effective and efficient complement to traditional university studies in providing students with skills and knowledge relevant to the labor market Governments are increasingly recognizing that the entire educational system from early childhood through tertiary education must reflect and be responsive to rapidly evolving social and economic demands and needs within an expanding globalized knowledge economy which increasingly demands a better trained more skilled and adaptable workforce There are around million students enrolled in tertiary education globally up from million in In Latin America and the Caribbean the number of students in tertiary education programs has increased since the early s but quality concerns remain In Sub Saharan Africa enrollments have doubled every twenty years since the late s This massive growth remains critical as a student with a tertiary education degree in the region will earn more than twice as much as a student with just a high school diploma over a lifetime though of course a variety of factors such as social capital and networks institution quality and academic program selection are among the factors that lead to notable heterogeneity of outcomes at for individual students in every country Across the expanding pool of graduates of tertiary education matching the skills developed today to the needs of the labor market of both today and of the future remains a major challenge At the same time expanded enrollments increase the strain on publicly funded institutions of higher learning and many countries with limited resources are struggling to finance the growing needs of a larger student body without compromising the quality of their educational offerings Tertiary education also remains out of reach for many of the world s poorest and most marginalized In Latin America and the Caribbean on average the poorest of the population only represented of tertiary education students in In Sub Saharan Africa only of the traditional aged cohort for tertiary education continues from secondary to tertiary education the lowest regional enrollment rate in the world Countries all over the world have undertaken major restructuring of their tertiary education systems to enhance their reach and effectiveness However progress has been uneven All countries engaging in strategic reforms of their tertiary sectors benefit from ensuring that their national strategies and policies prioritize equitable access improved learning and skills development efficient retention and considerations of the employment and education outcomes sought by graduates and the labor market Both policies and academic degrees need to be strategically tailored to fit the needs of the local society and economy Only then can governments realize the gains in primary and secondary school attainment through tertiary education access and progression and turn these successes into increased and sustained economic and social development Last Updated Apr STRATEGIC POLICY ADVICE As the world seeks to build back better into a new era of green and equitable economic growth tertiary education systems are at the heart of the big transformations required throughout economies and societies Tertiary education is vital for the development of human capital and innovation Strategic and effective investments in tertiary education can serve every country from the poorest to the richest by developing its talent and leadership pool generating and applying knowledge to local and global challenges and participating in the global knowledge economy Effective tertiary education systems ensure that countries have well trained doctors nurses teachers managers engineers and technicians who are the main actors of effective education and health service delivery and public and private sector development The imperative for investing in tertiary education derives from two major questions What are the benefits of investing and what are the consequences of not investing The benefits include higher employment levels that is lower levels of unemployment higher wages greater social stability increased civic engagement and better health outcomes Even more significant and perhaps revealing is examining what happens when countries underinvest in their tertiary education systems The consequences of underinvestment include brain drain and talent loss limited access to applied research capacity for local problem solving limitations to economic growth due to low levels of skills in the workforce low quality teaching and learning at every level of education and perhaps most glaringly expanded wealth inequality within and among nations with those investing proportionately more experiencing resultant growth rates far outpacing those with lower levels of investment and strategic development Key elements of strategic policy advice for tertiary education Decades of insufficient and ineffective investment in postsecondary education and the advanced skills developed through higher learning opportunities have only exacerbated global equity gaps The World Bank s STEERing Tertiary Education Toward Resilient Systems that Delivery for All policy approach paper describes the approach of the World Bank to support the development of effective equitable efficient and resilient tertiary education systems and institutions The paper seeks to i reinforce the imperative that every country regardless of level of development invest thoughtfully and strategically in diversified well articulated and inclusive tertiary education systems ii provide a framework for policymakers and other tertiary education stakeholders to examine critical traits responding to the needs for advanced skills and lifelong learning in support of growth and development and key interventions for tertiary education systems in the decades ahead iii examine the impact of the COVID pandemic on the global tertiary education sector and share ideas that promote a resilient recovery from the crisis and iv provide key information about the decades of commitment the World Bank has shown to utilizing tertiary education for sustainable development including context concepts and scale of the World Bank s operational and analytical work Within this steering framework and with a view to turning the challenges wrought by the COVID crisis into opportunities for impactful reforms this paper encourages tertiary education policymakers and stakeholders to STEER their tertiary systems and institutions toward greater relevance and impact utilizing five framing principles I Strategically diversified systems supporting all postsecondary institutions ensuring agile articulated pathways and diversity of forms functions and missions II Technology designed and applied in a purposeful and equitable manner III Equity a universal approach to the benefits and opportunities of postsecondary learning IV Efficiency a goal oriented effective use of resources V Resilience the ability to persist flourish and deliver agreed goals despite adversity These five priorities present critical building blocks with which leaders and institutions can reframe and strengthen their tertiary education systems for greater impact on learning growth innovation and social development Last Updated Apr The World Bank Group WBG has a highly diversified portfolio of lending and technical assistance projects in tertiary education which deal with a variety of specific areas including quality assurance performance based funding schemes alignment of academic offerings with market needs public private partnerships and governance reform among others

Gretel ai Gretel ai Header Photo Credit sylv rob via ShutterStock How Gretel ai trained a FastCUT GAN using Python to generate realistic synthetic location data for any city in the world At Gretel ai our mission is to make it fast and easy for developers and data scientists to create production grade synthetic data To achieve this we ve designed a series of APIs that allow anyone to get up and running within minutes so they can identify transform and generate the data necessary to fuel the testing of modern software applications and AI ML models Python is the engine that powers much of Gretel s research development and deployment of our APIs and toolkit From a user experience perspective Python s extensive libraries and frameworks e g Scikit learn and TensorFlow for machine learning Spacy for text processing and Numpy for data exploration its ability to handle complex data structures and its turnkey integrations help us ensure Gretel s platform is easy to use and extensible to any workflow or project In this post we highlight how with the support of Python we created a GAN location generator that can use map images and geolocation data to create new synthetic training data that can help the model predict where a human or an e bike in this case might be for any location in the world with a high degree of statistical accuracy This proof of concept for making better predictions by combining and contextualizing different types of data has applications across industries such as improving medical diagnosis and financial market forecasts and even building realistic simulations in the metaverse If you want to try this experiment yourself all the tools code and data are open sourced and available on GitHub Generating realistic location data for users for testing or modeling simulations is a hard problem Current approaches just create random locations inside a box placing users in waterways or on top of buildings This inability to make accurate synthetic location data stifles a lot of innovative projects that require diverse and complex datasets to fuel their work Gretel s approach is to model this problem by encoding e bike location data as pixels in an image and then training that data as an image translation task similar to CycleGAN Pix pix and StyleGAN For this study we used the newer contrastive unpaired translation FastCUT model that was created by the authors of pix pix and CycleGAN as it s memory efficient fast for training i e useful for higher res locations and generalizes well with minimal parameter tuning For this case study we wanted to test if we could accurately predict the locations of scooters in one city based on training a GAN model using publicly available e bike data from other cities To do this we first fed our model image data of different city maps including DC Denver and San Diego then separately trained the model on tabular data of e bike locations throughout those cities which included time series data that captured the flow of e bike traffic too Here is an example of what the raw data looks like before and after it was combined Creating contextual learning by combining time series and image data There were three essential steps for training our model First we created the training data To do this we created a Domain A from a corpus of precise e bike locations on a map and a Domain B from the same maps but without locations Next we trained our FastCUT model on our new training data which includes both the labeled and unlabeled map images This was accomplished by training the model on translating Domain B Domain A Lastly once our initial model was trained we generated our synthetic dataset which we then used to further test and optimize the model s predictions for realistic user locations for a new city map This generative process required downloading new maps for a target location Domain C then running inference on the FastCUT model to predict scooter locations in other words translating Domain C Domain A and finally processing those images using OpenCV Python to find e bike locations and then convert them to geolocation i e latitudinal longitudinal data points With this information we built our synthetic location dataset and we re ready for testing With our model trained on real world San Diego e bike data we then repeated the same initial process of training our model with image data from various U S cities but then asked our model to predict the missing e bike location data The output was predictions that were statistically correlated with the accurate real world locations of the actual scooters In other words we successfully projected the relationships of those unique data attributes in a completely new environment at a very different time Comparison of real world and synthetic e bike locations We tested the same process and model for the city of Tokyo too with similar positive results Note that depending on where the city is in the world the physical distance between each latitude or longitude degree can vary significantly and we will need to use an ellipsoid based model to calculate precise offsets when mapping pixels to locations Fortunately the geopy Python library makes this easy E bike locations predicted across downtown Tokyo There were some definite false positives when viewing data across Tokyo particularly with locations being generated for waterways Perhaps further model tuning or providing more negative examples of waterways in the training data domain A or domain B would reduce false positives However results are encouraging given little model or dataset tuning with the model seemingly able to mimic the distributions and locations of the e bike dataset that it was trained on using maps from a different part of the world The important takeaway is that this is a proof of concept that you can make accurate predictions on synthetic location data from anywhere at any time because the underlying attributes are interchangeable at least when dealing with e bikes In this post we experimented with applying context from the visual domain e g city map data along with tabular data to create realistic location data for cities around the globe This exciting case study has far reaching implications for the development of advanced software applications and powerful AI ML models across industries For example someday using similar machine learning techniques healthcare practitioners could quickly process the text of written doctor s notes along with X ray images and then synthesize secure versions of that data which can be used to better diagnose and treat patients With quality synthetic data and a little Python code the possibilities are endless Try the experiment yourself and let us know what you think would be an exciting use case for the FastCUT GAN location generator About the Author Alex Watson is a co founder and CPO of Gretel ai the developer stack for synthetic

Introduced into the philosophical lexicon during the Eighteenth Century the term aesthetic has come to designate among other things a kind of object a kind of judgment a kind of attitude a kind of experience and a kind of value For the most part aesthetic theories have divided over questions particular to one or another of these designations whether artworks are necessarily aesthetic objects how to square the allegedly perceptual basis of aesthetic judgments with the fact that we give reasons in support of them how best to capture the elusive contrast between an aesthetic attitude and a practical one whether to define aesthetic experience according to its phenomenological or representational content how best to understand the relation between aesthetic value and aesthetic experience But questions of more general nature have lately arisen and these have tended to have a skeptical cast whether any use of aesthetic may be explicated without appeal to some other whether agreement respecting any use is sufficient to ground meaningful theoretical agreement or disagreement whether the term ultimately answers to any legitimate philosophical purpose that justifies its inclusion in the lexicon The skepticism expressed by such general questions did not begin to take hold until the later part of the th century and this fact prompts the question whether a the concept of the aesthetic is inherently problematic and it is only recently that we have managed to see that it is or b the concept is fine and it is only recently that we have become muddled enough to imagine otherwise Adjudicating between these possibilities requires a vantage from which to take in both early and late theorizing on aesthetic matters The concept of the aesthetic descends from the concept of taste Why the concept of taste commanded so much philosophical attention during the th century is a complicated matter but this much is clear the eighteenth century theory of taste emerged in part as a corrective to the rise of rationalism particularly as applied to beauty and to the rise of egoism particularly as applied to virtue Against rationalism about beauty the eighteenth century theory of taste held the judgment of beauty to be immediate against egoism about virtue it held the pleasure of beauty to be disinterested Rationalism about beauty is the view that judgments of beauty are judgments of reason i e that we judge things to be beautiful by reasoning it out where reasoning it out typically involves inferring from principles or applying concepts At the beginning of the th century rationalism about beauty had achieved dominance on the continent and was being pushed to new extremes by les g om tres a group of literary theorists who aimed to bring to literary criticism the mathematical rigor that Descartes had brought to physics As one such theorist put it It was against this and against more moderate forms of rationalism about beauty that mainly British philosophers working mainly within an empiricist framework began to develop theories of taste The fundamental idea behind any such theory which we may call the immediacy thesis is that judgments of beauty are not or at least not canonically mediated by inferences from principles or applications of concepts but rather have all the immediacy of straightforwardly sensory judgments It is the idea in other words that we do not reason to the conclusion that things are beautiful but rather sense that they are Here is an early expression of the thesis from Jean Baptiste Dubos s Critical Reflections on Poetry Painting and Music which first appeared in And here is a late expression from Kant s Critique of the Power of Judgment But the theory of taste would not have enjoyed its eighteenth century run nor would it continue now to exert its influence had it been without resources to counter an obvious rationalist objection There is a wide difference so goes the objection between judging the excellence of a ragout and judging the excellence of a poem or a play More often than not poems and plays are objects of great complication But taking in all that complication requires a lot of cognitive work including the application of concepts and the drawing of inferences Judging the beauty of poems and plays then is evidently not immediate and so evidently not a matter of taste The chief way of meeting this objection was first to distinguish between the act of grasping the object preparatory to judging it and the act of judging the object once grasped and then to allow the former but not the latter to be as concept and inference mediated as any rationalist might wish Here is Hume with characteristic clarity Hume like Shaftesbury and Hutcheson before him and Reid after him Cooper Hutcheson Reid regarded the faculty of taste as a kind of internal sense Unlike the five external or direct senses an internal or reflex or secondary sense is one that depends for its objects on the antecedent operation of some other mental faculty or faculties Reid characterizes internal sense as follows Because of the highly complex natures or structures of many beautiful objects there will have to be a role for reason in their perception But perceiving the nature or structure of an object is one thing Perceiving its beauty is another Egoism about virtue is the view that to judge an action or trait virtuous is to take pleasure in it because you believe it to serve some interest of yours Its central instance is the Hobbesian view still very much on early eighteenth century minds that to judge an action or trait virtuous is to take pleasure in it because you believe it to promote your safety Against Hobbesian egoism a number of British moralists preeminently Shaftesbury Hutcheson and Hume argued that while a judgment of virtue is a matter of taking pleasure in response to an action or trait the pleasure is disinterested by which they meant that it is not self interested Cooper Hutcheson Hume One argument went roughly as follows That we judge virtue by means of an immediate sensation of pleasure means that judgments of virtue are judgments of taste no less than judgments of beauty But pleasure in the beautiful is not self interested we judge objects to be beautiful whether or not we believe them to serve our interests But if pleasure in the beautiful is disinterested there is no reason to think that pleasure in the virtuous cannot also be Hutcheson The eighteenth century view that judgments of virtue are judgments of taste highlights a difference between the eighteenth century concept of taste and our concept of the aesthetic since for us the concepts aesthetic and moral tend oppose one another such that a judgment s falling under one typically precludes its falling under the other Kant is chiefly responsible for introducing this difference He brought the moral and the aesthetic into opposition by re interpreting what we might call the disinterest thesis the thesis that pleasure in the beautiful is disinterested though see Cooper and Home for anticipations of Kant s re interpretation According to Kant to say that a pleasure is interested is not to say that it is self interested in the Hobbesian sense but rather that it stands in a certain relation to the faculty of desire The pleasure involved in judging an action to be morally good is interested because such a judgment issues in a desire to bring the action into existence i e to perform it To judge an action to be morally good is to become aware that one has a duty to perform the action and to become so aware is to gain a desire to perform it By contrast the pleasure involved in judging an object to be beautiful is disinterested because such a judgment issues in no desire to do anything in particular If we can be said to have a duty with regard to beautiful things it appears to be exhausted in our judging them aesthetically to be beautiful That is what Kant means when he says that the judgment of taste is not practical but rather merely contemplative Kant By thus re orienting the notion of disinterest Kant brought the concept of taste into opposition with the concept of morality and so into line more or less with the present concept of the aesthetic But if the Kantian concept of taste is continuous more or less with the present day concept of the aesthetic why the terminological discontinuity Why have we come to prefer the term aesthetic to the term taste The not very interesting answer appears to be that we have preferred an adjective to a noun The term aesthetic derives from the Greek term for sensory perception and so preserves the implication of immediacy carried by the term taste Kant employed both terms though not equivalently according to his usage aesthetic is broader picking out a class of judgments that includes both the normative judgment of taste and the non normative though equally immediate judgment of the agreeable Though Kant was not the first modern to use aesthetic Baumgarten had used it as early as the term became widespread only though quickly after his employment of it in the third Critique Yet the employment that became widespread was not exactly Kant s but a narrower one according to which aesthetic simply functions as an adjective corresponding to the noun taste So for example we find Coleridge in expressing the wish that he could find a more familiar word than aesthetic for works of taste and criticism before going on to argue The availability of an adjective corresponding to taste has allowed for the retiring of a series of awkward expressions the expressions judgment of taste emotion of taste and quality of taste have given way to the arguably less offensive aesthetic judgment aesthetic emotion and aesthetic quality However as the noun taste phased out we became saddled with other perhaps equally awkward expressions including the one that names this entry Much of the history of more recent thinking about the concept of the aesthetic can be seen as the history of the development of the immediacy and disinterest theses Artistic formalism is the view that the artistically relevant properties of an artwork the properties in virtue of which it is an artwork and in virtue of which it is a good or bad one are formal merely where formal properties are typically regarded as properties graspable by sight or by hearing merely Artistic formalism has been taken to follow from both the immediacy and the disinterest theses Binkley Carroll If you take the immediacy thesis to imply the artistic irrelevance of all properties whose grasping requires the use of reason and you include representational properties in that class then you are apt to think that the immediacy thesis implies artistic formalism If you take the disinterest thesis to imply the artistic irrelevance of all properties capable of practical import and you include representational properties in that class then you are apt to think that the disinterest thesis implies artistic formalism This is not to suggest that the popularity enjoyed by artistic formalism during the late th and early th centuries owed mainly to its inference from the immediacy or disinterest theses The most influential advocates of formalism during this period were professional critics and their formalism derived at least in part from the artistic developments with which they were concerned As a critic Eduard Hanslick advocated for the pure music of Mozart Beethoven Schumann and later Brahms and against the dramatically impure music of Wagner as a theorist he urged that music has no content but tonally moving forms Hanslick As a critic Clive Bell was an early champion of the post Impressionists especially Cezanne as a theorist he maintained that the formal properties of painting relations and combinations of lines and colours alone have artistic relevance Bell As a critic Clement Greenberg was abstract expressionism s ablest defender as a theorist he held painting s proper area of competence to be exhausted by flatness pigment and shape Greenberg Not every influential defender of formalism has also been a professional critic Monroe Beardsley who arguably gave formalism its most sophisticated articulation was not Beardsley Nor is Nick Zangwill who recently has mounted a spirited and resourceful defense of a moderate version of formalism Zangwill But formalism has always been sufficiently motivated by art critical data that once Arthur Danto made the case that the data no longer supported it and perhaps never really had formalism s heyday came to an end Inspired in particular by Warhol s Brillo Boxes which are more or less perceptually indistinguishable from the brand printed cartons in which boxes of Brillo were delivered to supermarkets Danto observed that for most any artwork it is possible to imagine both a another object that is perceptually indiscernible from it but which is not an artwork and b another artwork that is perceptually indiscernible from it but which differs in artistic value From these observations he concluded that form alone neither makes an artwork nor gives it whatever value it has Danto Danto Danto But Danto has taken the possibility of such perceptual indiscernibles to show the limitations not merely of form but also of aesthetics and he has done so on the grounds apparently that the formal and the aesthetic are co extensive Regarding a urinal Duchamp once exhibited and a perceptual indiscernible ordinary urinal Danto maintains that But the inference from the limits of the artistically formal to the limits of the artistically aesthetic is presumably only as strong as the inferences from the immediacy and disinterest theses to artistic formalism and these are not beyond question The inference from the disinterest thesis appears to go through only if you employ a stronger notion of disinterest than the one Kant understands himself to be employing Kant it is worth recalling regards poetry as the highest of the fine arts precisely because of its capacity to employ representational content in the expression of what he calls aesthetic ideas Kant see Costello and for extended treatment of the capacity of Kantian aesthetics to accommodate conceptual art The inference from the immediacy thesis appears to go through only if you employ a notion of immediacy stronger than the one Hume for example takes himself to be defending when he claims in a passage quoted in section that in many orders of beauty particularly those of the fine arts it is requisite to employ much reasoning in order to feel the proper sentiment Hume It may be that artistic formalism results if you push either of the tendencies embodied in the immediacy and disinterest theses to extremes It may be that the history of aesthetics from the th century to the mid Twentieth is largely the history of pushing those two tendencies to extremes It does not follow that those tendencies must be so pushed Consider Warhol s Brillo Boxes Danto is right to maintain that the eighteenth century theorist of taste would not know how to regard it as an artwork But this is because the eighteenth century theorist of taste lives in the th century and so would be unable to situate that work in its twentieth century art historical context and not because the kind of theory she holds forbids her from situating a work in its art historical context When Hume for instance observes that artists address their works to particular historically situated audiences and that a critic therefore must place herself in the same situation as the audience to whom a work is addressed Hume he is allowing that artworks are cultural products and that the properties that works have as the cultural products they are are among the ingredients of the composition that a critic must grasp if she is to feel the proper sentiment Nor does there seem to be anything in the celebrated conceptuality of Brillo Boxes nor of any other conceptual work that ought to give the eighteenth century theorist pause Francis Hutcheson asserts that mathematical and scientific theorems are objects of taste Hutcheson Alexander Gerard asserts that scientific discoveries and philosophical theories are objects of taste Gerard Neither argues for his assertion Both regard it as commonplace that objects of intellect may be objects of taste as readily as objects of sight and hearing may be Why should the present day aesthetic theorist think otherwise If an object is conceptual in nature grasping its nature will require intellectual work If grasping an object s conceptual nature requires situating it art historically then the intellectual work required to grasp its nature will include situating it art historically But as Hume and Reid held see section grasping the nature of an object preparatory to aesthetically judging it is one thing aesthetically judging the object once grasped is another Though Danto has been the most influential and persistent critic of formalism his criticisms are no more decisive than those advanced by Kendall Walton in his essay Categories of Art Walton s anti formalist argument hinges on two main theses one psychological and one philosophical According to the psychological thesis which aesthetic properties we perceive a work as having depends on which category we perceive the work as belonging to Perceived as belonging to the category of painting Picasso s Guernica will be perceived as violent dynamic vital disturbing Walton But perceived as belonging to the category of guernicas where guernicas are works with surfaces with the colors and shapes of Picasso s Guernica but the surfaces are molded to protrude from the wall like relief maps of different kinds of terrain Picasso s Guernica will be perceived not as violent and dynamic but as cold stark lifeless or serene and restful or perhaps bland dull boring Walton That Picasso s Guernica can be perceived both as violent and dynamic and as not violent and not dynamic might be thought to imply that there is no fact of the matter whether it is violent and dynamic But this implication holds only on the assumption that there is no fact of the matter which category Picasso s Guernica actually belongs to and this assumption appears to be false given that Picasso intended that Guernica be a painting and did not intend that it be a guernica and that the category of paintings was well established in the society in which Picasso painted it while the category of guernicas was not Hence the philosophical thesis according to which the aesthetic properties a work actually has are those it is perceived as having when perceived as belonging to the category or categories it actually belongs to Since the properties of having been intended to be a painting and having been created in a society in which painting is well established category are artistically relevant though not graspable merely by seeing or hearing the work it seems that artistic formalism cannot be true I do not deny Walton concludes that paintings and sonatas are to be judged solely on what can be seen or heard in them when they are perceived correctly But examining a work with the senses can by itself reveal neither how it is correct to perceive it nor how to perceive it that way Walton But if we cannot judge which aesthetic properties paintings and sonatas have without consulting the intentions and the societies of the artists who created them what of the aesthetic properties of natural items With respect to them it may appear as if there is nothing to consult except the way they look and sound so that an aesthetic formalism about nature must be true Allen Carlson a central figure in the burgeoning field of the aesthetics of nature argues against this appearance Carlson observes that Walton s psychological thesis readily transfers from works of art to natural items that we perceive Shetland ponies as cute and charming and Clydesdales as lumbering surely owes to our perceiving them as belonging to the category of horses Carlson He also maintains that the philosophical thesis transfers whales actually have the aesthetic properties we perceive them as having when we perceive them as mammals and do not actually have any contrasting aesthetic properties we might perceive them to have when we perceive them as fish If we ask what determines which category or categories natural items actually belong to the answer according to Carlson is their natural histories as discovered by natural science Carlson Inasmuch as a natural item s natural history will tend not to be graspable by merely seeing or hearing it formalism is no truer of natural items than it is of works of art The claim that Walton s psychological thesis transfers to natural items has been widely accepted and was in fact anticipated as Carlson acknowledges by Ronald Hepburn Hepburn and The claim that Walton s philosophical thesis transfers to natural items has proven more controversial Carlson is surely right that aesthetic judgments about natural items are prone to be mistaken insofar as they result from perceptions of those items as belonging to categories to which they do not belong and insofar as determining which categories natural items actually belong to requires scientific investigation this point seems sufficient to undercut the plausibility of any very strong formalism about nature see Carlson for independent objections against such formalism Carlson however also wishes to establish that aesthetic judgments about natural items have whatever objectivity aesthetic judgments about works of art do and it is controversial whether Walton s philosophical claim transfers sufficiently to support such a claim One difficulty raised by Malcolm Budd Budd and and Robert Stecker Stecker c is that since there are many categories in which a given natural item may correctly be perceived it is unclear which correct category is the one in which the item is perceived as having the aesthetic properties it actually has Perceived as belonging to the category of Shetland ponies a large Shetland pony may be perceived as lumbering perceived as belonging to the category of horses the same pony may be perceived as cute and charming but certainly not lumbering If the Shetland pony were a work of art we might appeal to the intentions or society of its creator to determine which correct category is the one that fixes its aesthetic character But as natural items are not human creations they can give us no basis for deciding between equally correct but aesthetically contrasting categorizations It follows according to Budd the aesthetic appreciation of nature is endowed with a freedom denied to the appreciation of art Budd though this is perhaps merely another way of saying that the aesthetic appreciation of art is endowed with an objectivity denied to the appreciation of nature The eighteenth century debate between rationalists and theorists of taste or sentimentalists was primarily a debate over the immediacy thesis i e over whether we judge objects to be beautiful by applying principles of beauty to them It was not primarily a debate over the existence of principles of beauty a matter over which theorists of taste might disagree Kant denied that there are any such principles Kant but both Hutcheson and Hume affirmed their existence they maintained that although judgments of beauty are judgments of taste and not of reason taste nevertheless operates according to general principles which might be discovered through empirical investigation Hutcheson Hume It is tempting to think of recent debate in aesthetics between particularists and generalists as a revival of the eighteenth century debate between rationalists and theorists of taste But the accuracy of this thought is difficult to gauge One reason is that it is often unclear whether particularists and generalists take themselves merely to be debating the existence of aesthetic principles or to be debating their employment in aesthetic judgment Another is that to the degree particularists and generalists take themselves to be debating the employment of aesthetic principles in aesthetic judgment it is hard to know what they can be meaning by aesthetic judgment If aesthetic still carries its eighteenth century implication of immediacy then the question under debate is whether judgment that is immediate is immediate If aesthetic no longer carries that implication then it is hard to know what question is under debate because it is hard to know what aesthetic judgment could be It may be tempting to think that we can simply re define aesthetic judgment such that it refers to any judgment in which an aesthetic property is predicated of an object But this requires being able to say what an aesthetic property is without reference to its being immediately graspable something no one seems to have done It may seem that we can simply re define aesthetic judgment such that it refers to any judgment in which any property of the class exemplified by beauty is predicated of an object But which class is this The classes exemplified by beauty are presumably endless and the difficulty is to specify the relevant class without reference to the immediate graspability of its members and that is what no one seems to have done However we are to sort out the particularist generalist debate important contributions to it include on the side of particularism Arnold Isenberg s Critical Communication Frank Sibley s Aesthetic Concepts in Sibley and Mary Mothersill s Beauty Restored and on the side of generalism Monroe Beardsley s Aesthetics and On the Generality of Critical Reasons Sibley s General Reasons and Criteria in Aesthetics in Sibley George Dickie s Evaluating Art Stephen Davies s Replies to Arguments Suggesting that Critics Strong Evaluations Could not be Soundly Deduced and John Bender s General but Defeasible Reasons in Aesthetic Evaluation The Generalist Particularist Dispute Of these the papers by Isenberg and Sibley have arguably enjoyed the greatest influence Isenberg concedes that we often appeal to descriptive features of works in support of our judgments of their value and he allows that this may make it seem as if we must be appealing to principles in making those judgments If in support of a favorable judgment of some painting a critic appeals to the wavelike contour formed by the figures clustered in its foreground it may seem as if his judgment must involve tacit appeal to the principle that any painting having such a contour is so much the better But Isenberg argues that this cannot be since no one agrees to any such principle But if in appealing to the descriptive features of a work we are not acknowledging tacit appeals to principles linking those features to aesthetic value what are we doing Isenberg believes we are offering directions for perceiving the work i e by singling out certain its features we are narrow ing down the field of possible visual orientations and thereby guiding others in the discrimination of details the organization of parts the grouping of discrete objects into patterns Isenberg In this way we get others to see what we have seen rather than getting them to infer what we have inferred That Sibley advances a variety of particularism in one paper and a variety of generalism in another will give the appearance of inconsistency where there is none Sibley is a particularist of one sort and with respect to one distinction and a generalist of another sort with respect to another distinction Isenberg as noted is a particularist with respect to the distinction between descriptions and verdicts i e he maintains that there are no principles by which we may infer from value neutral descriptions of works to judgments of their overall value Sibley s particularism and generalism by contrast both have to do with judgments falling in between descriptions and verdicts With respect to a distinction between descriptions and a set of judgments intermediate between descriptions and verdicts Sibley is straightforwardly particularist With respect to a distinction between a set of judgments intermediate between descriptions and verdicts and verdicts Sibley is a kind of generalist and describes himself as such Sibley s generalism as set forth in General Reasons and Criteria in Aesthetics begins with the observation that the properties to which we appeal in justification of favorable verdicts are not all descriptive or value neutral We also appeal to properties that are inherently positive such as grace balance dramatic intensity or comicality To say that a property is inherently positive is not to say that any work having it is so much the better but rather that its tout court attribution implies value So although a work may be made worse on account of its comical elements the simple claim that a work is good because comical is intelligible in a way that the simple claims that a work is good because yellow or because it lasts twelve minutes or because it contains many puns are not But if the simple claim that a work is good because comical is thus intelligible comicality is a general criterion for aesthetic value and the principle that articulates that generality is true But none of this casts any doubt on the immediacy thesis as Sibley himself observes The elsewhere referred to in the first sentence is Sibley s earlier paper Aesthetic Concepts which argues that the application of concepts such as balanced tragic comic or joyous is not a matter of determining whether the descriptive i e non aesthetic conditions for their application are met but is rather a matter of taste Hence aesthetic judgments are immediate in something like the way that judgments of color or of flavor are But Sibley recognizes as his eighteenth century forebears did and his formalist contemporaries did not that important differences remain between the exercise of taste and the use of the five senses Central among these is that we offer reasons or something like them in support of our aesthetic judgments by talking in particular by appealing to the descriptive properties on which the aesthetic properties depend we justify aesthetic judgments by bringing others to see what we have seen Sibley It is unclear to what degree Sibley beyond seeking to establish that the application of aesthetic concepts is not condition governed seeks also to define the term aesthetic in terms of their not being so It is clearer perhaps that he does not succeed in defining the term this way whatever his intentions Aesthetic concepts are not alone in being non condition governed as Sibley himself recognizes in comparing them with color concepts But there is also no reason to think them alone in being non condition governed while also being reason supportable since moral concepts to give one example at least arguably also have both these features Isolating the aesthetic requires something more than immediacy as Kant saw It requires something like the Kantian notion of disinterest or at least something to play the role played by that notion in Kant s theory Given the degree to which Kant and Hume continue to influence thinking about aesthetic judgment or critical judgment more broadly given the degree to which Sibley and Isenberg continue to abet that influence it is not surprising that the immediacy thesis is now very widely received The thesis however has come under attack notably by Davies and Bender See also Carroll who follows closely after Davies and Dorsch for further discussion Isenberg it will be recalled maintains that if the critic is arguing for her verdict her argumentation must go something as follows Since the critical principle expressed in premise is open to counter example no matter what property we substitute for p Isenberg concludes that we cannot plausibly interpret the critic as arguing for her verdict Rather than defend the principle expressed in premise Davies and Bender both posit alternative principles consistent with the fact that no property is good making in all artworks which they ascribe to the critic Davies proposes that we interpret the critic as arguing deductively from principles relativized to artistic type that is from principles holding that artworks of a specific types or categories Italian Renaissance paintings romantic symphonies Hollywood Westerns etc having p are better for having it Davies Bender proposes that we interpret the critic as arguing inductively from principles expressing mere tendencies that hold between certain properties and artworks principles in other words holding that artworks having p tend to be better for having it Bender Each proposal has its own weaknesses and strengths A problem with Bender s approach is that critics do not seem to couch their verdicts in probabilistic terms Were a critic to say that a work is likely to be good or almost certainly good or even that she has the highest confidence that it must be good her language would suggest that she had not herself experienced the work perhaps that she had judged the work on the basis of someone else s testimony hence that she is no critic at all We would therefore have good reason to prefer Davies s deductive approach if only we had good reason for thinking that relativizing critical principles to artistic type removed the original threat of counterexample Though it is clear that such relativizing reduces the relative number of counterexamples we need good reason for thinking that it reduces that number to zero and Davies provides no such reason Bender s inductive approach by contrast cannot be refuted by counterexample but only by counter tendency If the critic argues from the truth of a principle to the truth of a verdict as Davies and Bender both contend it must be possible for her to establish the truth of the principle before establishing the truth of the verdict How might she do this It seems unlikely that mere reflection on the nature of art or on the natures of types of art could yield up the relevant lists of good and bad making properties At least the literature has yet to produce a promising account as to how this might be done Observation therefore seems the most promising answer To say that the critic establishes the truth of critical principles on the basis of observation however is to say that she establishes a correlation between certain artworks she has already established to be good and certain properties she has already established those works to have But then any capacity to establish that works are good by inference from principles evidently depends on some capacity to establish that works are good without any such inference and the question arises why the critic should prefer to do by inference what she can do perfectly well without The answer cannot be that judging by inference from principle yields epistemically better results since a principle based on observations can be no more epistemically sound than the observations on which it is based None of this shows that aesthetic or critical judgment could never be inferred from principles It does however suggest that such judgment is first and foremost non inferential which is what the immediacy thesis holds The Kantian notion of disinterest has its most direct recent descendents in the aesthetic attitude theories that flourished from the early to mid th century Though Kant followed the British in applying the term disinterested strictly to pleasures its migration to attitudes is not difficult to explain For Kant the pleasure involved in a judgment of taste is disinterested because such a judgment does not issue in a motive to do anything in particular For this reason Kant refers to the judgment of taste as contemplative rather than practical Kant But if the judgment of taste is not practical then the attitude we bear toward its object is presumably also not practical when we judge an object aesthetically we are unconcerned with whether and how it may further our practical aims Hence it is natural to speak of our attitude toward the object as disinterested To say however that the migration of disinterest from pleasures to attitudes is natural is not to say that it is inconsequential Consider the difference between Kant s aesthetic theory the last great theory of taste and Schopenhauer s aesthetic theory the first great aesthetic attitude theory Whereas for Kant disinterested pleasure is the means by which we discover things to bear aesthetic value for Schopenhauer disinterested attention or will less contemplation is itself the locus of aesthetic value According to Schopenhauer we lead our ordinary practical lives in a kind of bondage to our own desires Schopenhauer This bondage is a source not merely of pain but also of cognitive distortion in that it restricts our attention to those aspects of things relevant to the fulfilling or thwarting of our desires Aesthetic contemplation being will less is therefore both epistemically and hedonically valuable allowing us a desire free glimpse into the essences of things as well as a respite from desire induced pain The two most influential aesthetic attitude theories of the th century are those of Edward Bullough and Jerome Stolnitz According to Stolnitz s theory which is the more straightforward of the two bearing an aesthetic attitude toward an object is a matter of attending to it disinterestedly and sympathetically where to attend to it disinterestedly is to attend to it with no purpose beyond that of attending to it and to attend to it sympathetically is to accept it on its own terms allowing it and not one s own preconceptions to guide one s attention of it Stolnitz The result of such attention is a comparatively richer experience of the object i e an experience taking in comparatively many of the object s features Whereas a practical attitude limits and fragments the object of our experience allowing us to see only those of its features which are relevant to our purposes By contrast the aesthetic attitude isolates the object and focuses upon it the look of the rocks the sound of the ocean the colors in the painting Stolnitz Bullough who prefers to speak of psychical distance rather than disinterest characterizes aesthetic appreciation as something achieved Bullough has been criticized for claiming that aesthetic appreciation requires dispassionate detachment But such a criticism seems to overlook a subtlety of Bullough s view While Bullough does hold that aesthetic appreciation requires distance between our own self and its affections Bullough he does not take this to require that we not undergo affections but quite the opposite only if we undergo affections have we affections from which to be distanced So for example the properly distanced spectator of a well constructed tragedy is not the over distanced spectator who feels no pity or fear nor the under distanced spectator who feels pity and fear as she would to an actual present catastrophe but the spectator who interprets the pity and fear she feels not as modes of her being but rather as characteristics of the phenomenon Bullough The properly distanced spectator of a tragedy we might say understands her fear and pity to be part of what tragedy is about The notion of the aesthetic attitude has been attacked from all corners and has very few remaining sympathizers George Dickie is widely regarded as having delivered the decisive blow in his essay The Myth of the Aesthetic Attitude Dickie by arguing that all purported examples of interested attention are really just examples of inattention So consider the case of the spectator at a performance of Othello who becomes increasingly suspicious of his own wife as the action proceeds or the case of the impresario who sits gauging the size of the audience or the case of the father who sits taking pride in his daughter s performance or the case of the moralist who sits gauging the moral effects the play is apt to produce in its audience These and all such cases will be regarded by the attitude theorist as cases of interested attention to the performance when they are actually nothing but cases of inattention to the performance the jealous husband is attending to his wife the impresario to the till the father to his daughter the moralist to the effects of the play But if none of them is attending to the performance then none of them is attending to it interestedly Dickie The attitude theorist however can plausibly resist Dickie s interpretation of such examples Clearly the impresario is not attending to the performance but there is no reason to regard the attitude theorist as committed to thinking otherwise As for the others it might be argued that they are all attending The jealous husband must be attending to the performance since it is the action of the play as presented by the performance that is making him suspicious The proud father must be attending to the performance since he is attending to his daughter s performance which is an element of it The moralist must be attending to the performance since he otherwise would have no basis by which to gauge its moral effects on the audience It may be that none of these spectators is giving the performance the attention it demands but that is precisely the attitude theorist s point But perhaps another of Dickie s criticisms one lesser known ultimately poses a greater threat to the ambitions of the attitude theorist Stolnitz it will be recalled distinguishes between disinterested and interested attention according to the purpose governing the attention to attend disinterestedly is to attend with no purpose beyond that of attending to attend interestedly is to attend with some purpose beyond that of attending But Dickie objects that a difference in purpose does not imply a difference in attention There is again much here that the attitude theorist can resist The idea that listening is a species of attending can be resisted the question at hand strictly speaking is not whether Jones and Smith listen to the music in the same way but whether they attend in the same way to the music they are listening to The contention that Jones and Smith are attending in the same way appears to be question begging as it evidently depends on a principle of individuation that the attitude theorist rejects if Jones s attention is governed by some ulterior purpose and Smith s is not and we individuate attention according to the purpose that governs it their attention is not the same Finally even if we reject the attitude theorist s principle of individuation the claim that there is but one way to attend to music is doubtful one can seemingly attend to music in myriad ways as historical document as cultural artifact as aural wallpaper as sonic disturbance depending on which of the music s features one attends to in listening to it But Dickie is nevertheless onto something crucial to the degree he urges that a difference in purpose need not imply a relevant difference in attention Disinterest plausibly figures in the definition of the aesthetic attitude only to the degree that it and it alone focuses attention on the features of the object that matter aesthetically The possibility that there are interests that focus attention on just those same features implies that disinterest has no place in such a definition which in turn implies that neither it nor the notion of the aesthetic attitude is likely to be of any use in fixing the meaning of the term aesthetic If to take the aesthetic attitude toward an object simply is to attend to its aesthetically relevant properties whether the attention is interested or disinterested then determining whether an attitude is aesthetic apparently requires first determining which properties are the aesthetically relevant ones And this task seems always to result either in claims about the immediate graspability of aesthetic properties which are arguably insufficient to the task or in claims about the essentially formal nature of aesthetic properties which are arguably groundless But that the notions of disinterest and psychical distance prove unhelpful in fixing the meaning of the term aesthetic does not imply that they are mythic At times we seem unable to get by without them Consider the case of The Fall of Miletus a tragedy written by the Greek dramatist Phrynicus and staged in Athens barely two years after the violent Persian capture of the Greek city of Miletus in BC Herodotus records that How are we to explain the Athenian reaction to this play without recourse to something like interest or lack of distance How in particular are we to explain the difference between the sorrow elicited by a successful tragedy and the sorrow elicited in this case The distinction between attention and inattention is of no use here The difference is not that the Athenians could not attend to The Fall whereas they could attend to other plays The difference is that they could not attend to The Fall as they could attend to other plays and this because of their too intimate connection to what attending to The Fall required their attending to Theories of aesthetic experience may be divided into two kinds according to the kind of feature appealed to in explanation of what makes experience aesthetic internalist theories appeal to features internal to experience typically to phenomenological features whereas externalist theories appeal to features external to the experience typically to features of the object experienced The distinction between internalist and externalist theories of aesthetic experience is similar though not identical to the distinction between phenomenal and epistemic conceptions of aesthetic experience drawn by Gary Iseminger Iseminger and Iseminger Though internalist theories particularly John Dewey s and Monroe Beardsley s predominated during the early and middle parts of the th century externalist theories including Beardsley s and George Dickie s have been in the ascendance since Beardsley s views on aesthetic experience make a strong claim on our attention given that Beardsley might be said to have authored the culminating internalist theory as well as the founding externalist one Dickie s criticisms of Beardsley s internalism make an equally strong claim since they moved Beardsley and with him most everyone else from internalism toward externalism According to the version of internalism Beardsley advances in his Aesthetics all aesthetic experiences have in common three or four depending on how you count features which some writers have discovered through acute introspection and which each of us can test in his own experience Beardsley These are focus an aesthetic experience is one in which attention is firmly fixed upon its object intensity and unity where unity is a matter of coherence and of completeness Beardsley Coherence in turn is a matter of having elements that are properly connected one to another such that Completeness by contrast is a matter having elements that counterbalance or resolve one another such that the whole stands apart from elements without it Dickie s most consequential criticism of Beardsley s theory is that Beardsley in describing the phenomenology of aesthetic experience has failed to distinguish between the features we experience aesthetic objects as having and the features aesthetic experiences themselves have So while every feature mentioned in Beardsley s description of the coherence of aesthetic experience continuity of development the absence of gaps the mounting of energy toward a climax surely is a feature we experience aesthetic objects as having there is no reason to think of aesthetic experience itself as having any such features Dickie raises a similar worry about Beardsley s description of the completeness of aesthetic experience Though these objections turned out to be only the beginning of the debate between Dickie and Beardsley on the nature of aesthetic experience See Beardsley Dickie Beardsley and Dickie see also Iseminger for a helpful overview of the Beardsley Dickie debate they nevertheless went a long way toward shaping that debate which taken as whole might be seen as the working out of an answer to the question What can a theory of aesthetic experience be that takes seriously the distinction between the experience of features and the features of experience The answer turned out to be an externalist theory of the sort that Beardsley advances in the essay The Aesthetic Point of View and that many others have advanced since a theory according to which an aesthetic experience just is an experience having aesthetic content i e an experience of an object as having the aesthetic features that it has The shift from internalism to externalism has meant that one central ambition of internalism that of tying the meaning of aesthetic to features internal to aesthetic experience has had to be given up But a second equally central ambition that of accounting for aesthetic value by grounding it in the value of aesthetic experience has been retained The following section takes up the development and prospects of such accounts To count as complete a theory of aesthetic value must answer two questions The literature refers to the first question sometimes as the aesthetic question Lopes Shelley and sometimes as the demarcation question van der Berg Matherne Peacocke It refers to the second as the normative question Lopes Shelley Matherne The prevailing answer to the aesthetic question is aesthetic formalism the view that aesthetic value is aesthetic because objects bear it in virtue of their perceptual properties where these encompass visual auditory gustatory olfactory and tactile properties Aesthetic formalism rose to prominence when and because artistic formalism did during the late th and early th centuries see Section Because everyone then took artistic value to be a species of aesthetic value artistic formalism could gain prominence only by dragging aesthetic formalism in its train But whereas artistic formalism has since fallen from favor aesthetic formalism has held its ground The explanation arguably has to do with the way aesthetic formalism honors the conceptual link between the aesthetic and the perceptual Any adequate answer to the aesthetic question must meet what we may call the perceptual constraint that is it must plausibly articulate the sense in which aesthetic value is perceptual Aesthetic formalism does this in the clearest possible terms Versions of aesthetic formalism come in varying strengths Its strongest versions hold objects to have aesthetic value strictly in virtue of their perceptual properties Bell Danto Weaker versions either allow objects to have aesthetic value in virtue of their non perceptual content so long as that content expresses itself perpetually Zangwill or require merely that objects paradigmatically have aesthetic value in virtue of their perceptual properties Levinson All versions of aesthetic formalism struggle one way or another to accommodate our long standing practice of ascribing aesthetic value to objects that do not address themselves primarily to the five bodily senses Consider works of literature We have been ascribing aesthetic value to them for as long as we have been ascribing aesthetic value to artworks of any kind How might the aesthetic theorist square her theory with this practice A first approach is simply to dismiss that practice regarding its participants as linguistically confused as applying terms of aesthetic praise to objects constitutionally incapable of meriting it Danto But given how extremely revisionist this approach is we ought to wait on an argument of proportionately extreme strength before adopting it A second approach allows that literary works bear aesthetic value but only in virtue of their sensory properties such as properties associated with assonance consonance rhythm and imagery Urmson Zangwill But this approach accounts for a mere fraction of the aesthetic value we routinely ascribe to works of literature Suppose you praise a short story for the eloquence of its prose and the beauty of its plot structure It seems arbitrary to count only the eloquence as a genuine instance of aesthetic value A third approach treats literary works as exceptional allowing them alone among works of art to bear aesthetic value in virtue of their non perceptual properties Binkley Levinson n The difficulty here is to explain literature s exceptionality If literary works somehow bear aesthetic value in virtue of non perceptual properties what prevents non literary works from doing the same Moreover to whatever degree we allow things to have aesthetic value in virtue of their non perceptual properties to that degree we sever the connection the formalist asserts between the aesthetic and the perceptual and so undermine our reason for adopting aesthetic formalism in the first place We might be forced to choose from among these three formalist approaches to literature if aesthetic formalism constituted the only plausible articulation of the sense in which aesthetic value is perceptual but it doesn t Instead of holding that aesthetic value is perceptual because things have it in virtue of their perpetual properties one might hold that aesthetic value is perceptual because we perceive things as having it This would be a corollary of the immediacy thesis as defined in Section If as that thesis holds aesthetic judgment is perceptual having all the immediacy of any standard perceptual judgment then aesthetic properties are perceptual grasped with all the immediacy of standard perceptual properties That aesthetic properties are thus perceptual is Sibley s point in the following Sibley says that people have to see the grace or unity of a work and they have to feel the power of a novel He doesn t say that they have to see the properties in virtue of which a work has grace or unity or feel the properties in virtue of which a novel has power the properties in virtue of which a work has grace or unity need not be perceptual and the properties in virtue of which a novel has power presumably will not be Thus the literature problem over which formalism stumbles does not arise for Sibley nor for anyone else committed to the immediacy thesis including Shaftesbury Cooper Hutcheson Hume Section I and Reid among others For the immediacy theorist the aesthetic value we ascribe to literary works is aesthetic because we perceive literary works as bearing it The prevailing answer to the normative question is aesthetic hedonism the view that aesthetic value is value because things having it give pleasure when experienced Aesthetic hedonism achieved prominence in the th century roughly when aesthetic formalism did Schopenhauer played a pivotal role in bringing it to prominence by reassigning disinterested pleasure from the role it had been playing in aesthetic judgment to the role of grounding aesthetic value Schopenhauer Bentham ch and Mill ch arguably played larger roles by popularizing value hedonism that is the view that pleasure is the ground of all value But whereas value hedonism no longer holds much sway in ethics and Schopenhauer no longer exerts much influence in aesthetics aesthetic hedonism has held its ground The explanation presumably has to do with the apparent ease with which aesthetic hedonism explains why we seek out objects of aesthetic value Any adequate answer to the normative question must meet what we may call the normative constraint that is it must plausibly identify what a thing s having aesthetic value gives us reason to do Aesthetic hedonism locating that reason in the pleasure taken in experiencing aesthetically valuable objects does this in the clearest possible terms Advocates of aesthetic hedonism include Schopenhauer Clive Bell C I Lewis Monroe Beardsley George Dickie Alan Goldman Kendall Walton Malcolm Budd Jerrold Levinson Gary Iseminger Robert Stecker Nick Stang and Mohan Matthen It is only quite recently that any sustained opposition to hedonism has arisen a fact that may go some way toward explaining why hedonists as a rule see no need to argue for their view opting instead to develop it in light of objections an imagined opposition might make Beardsley for instance leads with this simple formulation of hedonism But he then anticipates a fatal objection Sometimes we undervalue aesthetic objects finding them to have less value than they actually have other times we overvalue aesthetic objects finding them to have greater value than they actually have The simple formulation above is consistent with undervaluation since it is possible to take less aesthetic pleasure from an object than it has the capacity to provide but inconsistent with overvaluation since it is impossible to take greater aesthetic pleasure from an object than it has the capacity to provide Beardsley To remedy this problem Beardsley appends a rider Suppose we refer to the italicized portion of this formulation as the epistemic qualification and the non italicized portion as the hedonic thesis The epistemic qualification renders the hedonic thesis consistent with overvaluation given that you can misapprehend an object such that you take greater aesthetic pleasure from it than it has the capacity to provide when apprehended correctly and completely Beardsley s version of aesthetic hedonism has served as a model for subsequent versions Levinson n at least all subsequent versions consist of an epistemically qualified hedonic thesis in some form Beardsley s version however seems open to counter example Consider Tony Morrison s Beloved for instance or Cormac McCarthy s Blood Meridian Taking pleasure from works designed to cause shock horror despair or moral revulsion may seem perverse surely it may seem such works do not have whatever aesthetic value they have in virtue of any pleasure they give One way to accommodate such cases is to cast aesthetic pleasure as a higher order response that is a response that depends on lower order responses which in some cases might include shock horror despair and moral revulsion Walton Levinson Another way is to broaden the field of experiences that may ground aesthetic value Though pleasure as a rule grounds aesthetic value in exceptional cases certain non hedonic yet intrinsically valuable experiences which may include horror shock despair and revulsion may also do so Levinson Stecker The literature refers to this latter broadened variety of hedonism as aesthetic empiricism it hasn t settled on a name for the former variety but we may call it tiered hedonism given the varying levels of response it takes aesthetic experience to comprise Yet another objection anticipated by hedonists holds hedonism to imply the heresy of the separable experience Budd It is a commonplace that for any object bearing aesthetic value nothing other than it can have just the particular value it has excepting the improbable case in which something other than it has just its particular aesthetic character The worry is that hedonism given that it regards aesthetic value as instrumental to the value of experience implies that for any object bearing aesthetic value something wholly other from it such as a drug might induce the same experience and so serve up the same value The hedonist s usual reply is to assert that aesthetic experience is inseparable from its object such that for any aesthetic experience that experience is just the particular experience it is because it has just the particular aesthetic object it has Levinson Budd S Davies Stang Actual opposition to hedonism did not materialize until the present century Sharpe Davies and most all of that during the past decade or so Shelley Wolf Lopes Gorodeisky a b Why the opposition took so long to show up is a good question It is tempting to think its answer resides in the obvious truth of the hedonist s central premise namely that aesthetically valuable objects please us at least in general Anti hedonists however have taken no interest in denying this premise One useful way to think of the dialectic between hedonists and their opponents is to regard each as grasping one horn of an aesthetic version of the Euthyphro dilemma where hedonists hold things to have aesthetic value because they please and anti hedonists hold things to please because they have aesthetic value Augustine De vera religione Gorodeisky a and b Seen this way the fact that aesthetically valuable things please tells not at all in favor of the hedonist indeed it is precisely this fact that the anti hedonist thinks the hedonist cannot explain For instance Wolf in the context of an extended nuanced case against value welfarism argues that aesthetic hedonism cannot account for the fact that Middlemarch is a better novel than the Da Vinci Code given that most people apparently like the latter better presumably because it gives them greater pleasure Wolf see also Sharpe The hedonist has a ready reply in the claim that all standard versions of hedonism are now epistemically qualified that while most people may derive greater pleasure from the Da Vinci Code a fully informed reader that is a reader who gives both texts a correct and complete reading will not assuming Middlemarch to be the better novel But it s not clear how much appeal to the epistemic qualification ultimately helps the hedonist The anti hedonist will want to know what best explains the fact that a fully informed reader will derive greater pleasure from Middlemarch Wolf D Davies Sharpe Suppose we say that it owes to the fully informed reader s grasping the superiority of Middlemarch s structure the higher quality of its prose the greater subtlety and depth of its character development and the greater penetration of the insights it affords Wolf Wouldn t we then be saying that it owes to her grasping the greater aesthetic value of Middlemarch Wouldn t that be part of what a fully informed reader is fully informed about Of course the hedonist may allow Middlemarch to be aesthetically better because of its superior structure prose character development and insight to allow this from her point of view is simply to allow that these are the elements in virtue of which a fully informed reader will derive greater pleasure But here it would be good if the hedonist had an argument Otherwise the anti hedonist will rightly wonder how it is that a correct and complete experience of Middlemarch will be an experience of every value conferring feature of Middlemarch yet not an experience of the value conferred by those features She will rightly wonder whether the hedonist fails to honor her own commitment to externalism about aesthetic value she will rightly wonder in other words whether the hedonist fails to distinguish between a valuable experience and an experience of value just as the internalist about aesthetic value fails to distinguish between a coherent and complete experience and an experience of coherence and completeness Earlier we attributed the appeal of hedonism to the apparent ease with which it explains our seeking out objects of aesthetic value Anti hedonists take that ease to be apparent merely Some anti hedonists for instance argue that at least some aesthetically valuable objects offer up pleasure only on condition that we do not seek it Lopes Ven der Berg see also Elster Lopes puts the point this way Lopes s choice of example is not arbitrary There are particular art critical reasons for thinking that Chardins will frustrate the hedonically motivated viewer Fried cited in Lopes and Lopes is careful to claim that only some aesthetic pleasures are essential by products of acts motivated by other considerations Lopes But it s not as if Lopes s claim is specific to Chardins Consider again Wolf s assertation that most readers take greater pleasure from The Da Vinci Code than from Middlemarch If that assertion is correct as it plausibly is perhaps this is because a most readers read for pleasure and b The Da Vinci Code affords pleasure to readers who read for it whereas c Middlemarch withholds pleasure from such readers affording pleasure instead on readers who read in pursuit of some non hedonic good There is an apparent tension moreover between the hedonist s reliance on the epistemic qualification and her claim that pleasure rationalizes our aesthetic pursuits Consider the less than fully informed reader who overvalues The Da Vinci Code and undervalues Middlemarch The epistemic qualification is designed to allow the hedonist to explain how this might occur such a reader takes greater pleasure from The Da Vinci Code and less or lesser pleasure from Middlemarch than she would were she fully informed The epistemic qualification moreover allows the hedonist to explain why the uninformed reader has aesthetic reason not to undervalue Middlemarch she is missing out on pleasure that would be hers if only she gave Middlemarch a fully informed reading But the hedonist struggles to explain why the uninformed reader has reason not to overvalue the Da Vinci Code If The Da Vinci Code gives the reader greater pleasure when she overvalues it not only has she no aesthetic reason to be fully informed she has aesthetic reason not to be It therefore seems that if pleasure rationalized our hedonic pursuits we would take ourselves to have reason to experience aesthetic objects in whatever way maximizes our pleasure To the degree that we instead take ourselves to have reason to experience aesthetic objects completely and correctly to the degree that we instead take ourselves to have reason to experience aesthetic objects as having the aesthetic values they in fact have suggests that pleasure is not the aesthetic good we re after Shelley But if pleasure is not the aesthetic good we re after what is Part of hedonism s perceived inevitability over the past century or so has owed to our inability even to imagine alternatives to it If opposition to hedonism has been slow to materialize alternatives have been slower still To date the only fully realized alternative to hedonism is Lopes s network theory of aesthetic normativity articulated and defended in his ground breaking Being for Beauty Aesthetic Agency and Value Earlier we noted how Lopes challenges the hedonist on her own terms objecting that she cannot adequately explain why we seek out objects of aesthetic value given that aesthetic pleasure is at least sometimes an essential by product of our seeking after something else Lopes s deeper challenge however targets the hedonist s very terms Aesthetic considerations rationalize a very great variety of aesthetic acts according to Lopes appreciating objects of aesthetic value is one such act but so too is hanging a poster one way rather than another selecting this book rather than that one for a book club building out a garden this way rather than that conserving one video game rather than another pairing this dish with this wine rather than that one and so on ad infinitum If a theory of aesthetic value is to accommodate such a vast range of aesthetic acts without singling out any one as more central than the others it will have to conceive of aesthetic normativity as a species of some very general kind of normativity Lopes accordingly conceives of aesthetic normativity as a species of the most generic form of practical normativity that aesthetic acts ought to be performed well follows from the premise that all acts ought to be performed well for the simple reason that they are acts As Lopes puts it Aesthetic values inherit their practical normativity from a basic condition of all agency agents must use what they have to perform successfully Just which competencies an aesthetic agent may call upon to perform successfully on any given occasion depends on the particular role they happen to be playing in the particular social practice in which they happen to be performing It is from the fact that all aesthetic activity necessarily takes place within the domain of some particular social practice that the network theory of aesthetic value takes its name In holding aesthetic agents to be performing the greatest variety of aesthetic acts on the greatest variety of items in coordination with one another the network theory departs radically from hedonism But as Lopes himself observes the network theory follows after hedonism in one fundamental way inasmuch as both theories answer the normative question but offer nothing in answer to the aesthetic question both are consistent with any stand alone answer to the aesthetic question The claim that the normative and aesthetic questions admit of stand alone answers implies that aesthetic value is a species of the genus value in a standard species genus relation such that what makes aesthetic value value has no bearing on what makes it aesthetic and vice versa It therefore also implies that aesthetic value is not a determinate of the determinable value such that what makes aesthetic value aesthetic is very thing that makes it value Do answers to the normative and aesthetic questions stand alone or stand together If we have not yet registered the urgency of this question perhaps that is because no one has yet fully articulated let alone defended a theory of aesthetic value according to which aesthetic value is a determinate form of value Such a theory appears to be implicit however in Shelley Watkins and Shelley Gorodeisky and Marcus Gorodeisky a and Shelley The position common to these authors has been dubbed the Auburn view Van der Berg It answers the aesthetic question and therein the value question by holding an item s having aesthetic value to rationalize its appreciation in a distinctively self reflexive way such that part of what you perceive when you appreciate an aesthetically valuable item is that it ought to be appreciated as you appreciating it Shelley Watkins and Shelley Gorodeisky and Marcus Gorodeisky a Shelley The network theorist may object that the Auburn view privileges acts of appreciation as surely as hedonism does but such an objection from the Auburn perspective begs the question It is in assuming that the normative and aesthetic questions admit of stand alone answers that the network theorist grants herself the freedom of passing on the aesthetic question and it is in passing on the aesthetic question that she grants herself the freedom of treating each of a very great variety of aesthetic acts as equally central It is in assuming that aesthetic value is a determinate of the determinable value meanwhile that the Auburnite places herself under the necessity of answering the aesthetic question and it is in seeking an answer to the aesthetic question that she places herself under the necessity of singling out appreciation as aesthetically central The network theorist and the Auburnite agree that the aesthetic question deserves an answer sooner or later Lopes They disagree crucially about whether it deserves an answer sooner rather than later The network theory and the Auburn view hardly exhaust the options for non hedonic theories of aesthetic normativity Nguyen Matherne Peacocke Kubala and Riggle all represent promising new directions Yet every new theory of aesthetic value hedonic or not must follow after the network theory or the Auburn view in regarding answers to the normative and aesthetic questions as stand alone or stand together A lot
